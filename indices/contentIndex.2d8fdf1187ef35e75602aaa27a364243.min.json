This book covers the history of our study of the cosmos from prehistory to a survey of modern astronomy and astrophysics. It does not attempt to cover everything, but deliberately concentrates on the important themes and topics, including stellar astronomy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--the source of many important concepts in modern astronomy--and the Copernican revolution, which led to the challenge of ancient authorities in many areas other than astronomy. This is an essential text for students of the history of science and for students of astronomy who require a historical background to their studies.\n\n#### Text, pp43-44\n![[ptolemy-model.png]]\nThe technical ingenuity that Ptolemy's displays in the Almagest is illustrated by his model of the motion in longitude (that is, around the Sun's path or 'ecliptic') of one of the planets Mars, Jupiter or Saturn. The Earth is at 0, and M is the centre of the large (deferent) circle. C is a point on the deferent circle, and is itself the centre of the epicycle on which travels the planet P. E is a point (the equant point) on the line OM (extended), such that OM=ME. C moves around on the deferent circle with a variable angular velocity, such that, viewed from the equant point E, it appears to be travelling uniformly. P moves on the epicycle in such a way that CP is always parallel to the line from O to the 'mean Sun' (reflecting the fact that the Earth-based observer is in reality in motion around the Sun). The ratio of the radii of the circles, the 'eccentrity' OM, and the two angular velocities, are then chosen to fit the motion of the particular planet.\n\n---\ndebate in the universities of the medieval West. It would be difficult enough for university students of Arts to reconcile eccentres and epicycles with what they were taught in their natural philosophy about the uniform motions of the Aristotelian concentric spheres; to reconcile the equant was quite impossible. \n\nFor this very reason, Copernicus in the sixteenth century would see it as a matter for self-congratulation, that his models needed no equants. \n\nIn the Almagest, Ptolemy provided geometric models that would, with fair accuracy, predict the motions of every one of the seven wanderers. He showed how the all-important parameters in his models could be derived from observations, though his general strategy was to work in the opposite direction: to present the models and then to 'test' them by comparing deductions from them against observations. With the help of the Almagest, mathematical astronomers (and astrologers) would be able to calculate tables of the positions of a planet in longitude and latitude for the indefinite future. \n\nThere were of course problems. He had found that the model for the Moon as adapted from Hipparchus represented well enough positions of the planet when Earth, Sun and Moon were in a straight line -unsurprisingly, in view of the use Hipparchus had made of Babylonian eclipse\n`p44`\nrecords in deriving his model but was unsatisfactory elsewhere. To remedy the defect, and so account for the Moon's irregularity that later became known as 'evection', he introduced a 'crank' mechanism that varied the distance from Earth of the Moon's epicycle. When Earth, Sun and Moon were aligned, the crank was fully extended and its presence made no difference; but elsewhere the crank pulled in the epicycle towards the Earth, most of all when the angle Sun-Earth-Moon was a right angle. The resulting model was satisfactory as far as computing lunar positions was concerned, but it implied that the height of the Moon above the Earth varied between 33 and 64 Earth radii. This ought to have resulted in its apparent diameter varying by a factor of nearly two; yet such variations were not in fact observed in the real Moon. How much this bothered Ptolemy's readers depended on whether they were looking for something more than accurate tables of position. \n\nAnother problem stemmed from a curious fact of observation. Two of the lesser planets -Mercury and Venus are never to be seen far from the Sun: they rise and set with the Sun, unlike Mars, Jupiter and Saturn which may be seen in the sky at any time of night. Ptolemy replicated this in his models for Venus and Mercury by aligning the centres of their epicycles with the 'mean Sun', sO that all three had the same period of one year. Some of his readers, however, were unhappy with such an ad hoc device. \n\nBut these were details. Ptolemy's Almagest achieved what it set out to do: to provide a set of geometrical models for calculating accurate tables of the future positions in the sky of each of the seven planets. It marked the culmination of centuries of effort.\n\nPtolemy made no attempt in the Almagest to present an integrated 'Ptolemaic System' of the heavens, but he did permit himself a few sentences on the order of the planets, in terms of their respective heights above the central Earth. It seemed plausible to make the fixed stars the outermost (as indeed Eudoxus and Aristotle had assumed half millennium before), and to place nearest to these stars those planets whose motions most closely imitated the motion of the stars. On this basis Saturn -whose motion differed from that of the stars by only one circuit every thirty years -was the highest of the planets, with Jupiter (one in twelve years) and Mars (one in two years) next. At the other extreme, the Moon (one each month) was to be placed closest to the Earth.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.056978346Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/1844-The-Count-of-Monte-Cristo-book":{"title":"1844 - The Count of Monte Cristo (book)","content":"up:: [[Sources MOC]]\ntags:: #source/book\ndates:: 1844\n\n# 1844 üìö The Count of Monte Cristo\n\n\u003e The **Count of monte cristo** (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel  written by French author [[Alexandre Dumas]] (p√®re) completed in 1844.

Eventually, through repeating the same day for decades, he accepts his fate, tries less, and gives more. Only then does he break the cycle of Groundhog Day. \n\nHere's the thing, we're all repeating the same day for decades, and something deep within me feels that just like Phil, we too can slightly break away from the cycle of Samsara by accepting more, trying less, and giving more.

Or [[Siddhartha]]'s for that matter?\n\nAlthough the idea of replaying opportunities in life could seem like a gift, it becomes a trap if we become consumed by it. This is where each action of ours has consequences. And this is the law of [[Karma]]: Phil makes choices. Each choice leads to a new reality. We often choose the cycle of Samsara and suffering. But the profound existential message is that, even in our darkest hour, even when we are at our lowest point, within that fire of suffering are the seeds of renewal‚Äîof Spring.

Understanding the processing basis of self‚Äêcontrol strength, and more particularly its depletion, is thus of paramount importance to both basic and applied literatures. Self‚Äêcontrol strength, the present review suggests, can be profitably viewed in cognitive control terms, particularly so in relation to operations of a brain‚Äêbased cognitive control circuit involving the anterior cingulate cortex (linked to monitoring potential or actual unwanted outcomes) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (linked to controlling potential or actual unwanted outcomes). Also, sufficient task motivation is important to operations of this circuit and depletion effects might be understood in terms of such depletion effects on task motivation. Multiple sources of evidence are marshaled in support of this cognitive control perspective of self‚Äêcontrol strength. It is concluded that viewing self‚Äêcontrol strength in cognitive control terms has considerable merit. Social, cognitive, personality, and clinical sources of data are integrated in the analysis.\n\t- why: \n\n#### Extracted Annotations (3/7/2015, 4:26:55 PM)\n\n\"William James (1890) was among the first psychologists to highlight the importance of self-control to adaptive functioning.\" (Robinson et al 2010:189)\n\n\"The self-control and cognitive control literatures, thus, would seem to overlap considerably in their mutual concern with the person's ability to inhibit dominant responses in a task-defined or otherwise strategic manner (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001; van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006).\" (Robinson et al 2010:191)\n\n\"In neurocognitive terms, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in monitoring problematic processing and behavioral occurrences (van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006), whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is involved in instantiating cognitive control in a goal-directed (rather than habitual) manner (Kerns et al., 2004; Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005).\" (Robinson et al 2010:191)\n\n\"we suggest that self-control is probably not special, but rather borrows from a general-purpose brain-based system related to concern with, monitoring of, and remediation of problematic events and behaviors of multiple types (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"An energizer of the cognitive control system is motivation (Sarter, Gehring, \u0026 Kozak, 2006). Stated in other terms, if there is low motivation to control a problematic tendency, it is unlikely that the cognitive control system of the prefrontal cortex will be recruited. This in turn would result in suboptimal performance (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005). Thus, one major component to self-control strength is likely one's willingness to work hard on a difficult task.\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Potentially separable from self-control capacity or even task motivation is what we term task monitoring. To perform non-habitual tasks well, potential or actual mistakes must be recognized. In the absence of recognizing error-proneness, cognitive and behavioral habits would dominate (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005)\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Although many of these habits would generally serve the self, many would not (Bargh \u0026 Chartrand, 1999).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192) ^309fcc\n\n\"The success (versus failure) of cognitive control is primarily a result of dlPFC activation (Kerns et al., 2004) and the processes uniquely implemented by this brain structure (Knight \u0026 Stuss, 2002).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"Note that these consequences of dlPFC damage are highly consistent with impaired self-control as highlighted by the strength-based theory of self-control (Baumeister et al., 2000). Thus, it is suggested that the recruitment of the dlPFC's resources should play an important role in understanding whether self-control will be instantiated or not (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:192)\n\n\"These data strongly suggest that basic processes related to cognitive control (e.g., working memory, reliant on the dlPFC: Goldberg, 2001) overlap considerably with those involved in self-control of a more molar social type (e.g., suppressing one's emotional displays).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"In sum, there appears to be a close potential link between lower levels of task-motivation and self-control failures.\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"The latter result is particularly important because numerous studies have now shown that being mindful of present reality (i.e., monitoring it to a greater extent) mitigates even clinical tendencies toward depression (Williams, 2008).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"Compton et al. (2008) found that individuals displaying stronger ERN responses to errors (reflecting error-monitoring processes: Holroyd \u0026 Coles, 2002) were better able to control their emotional reactions to stressors in daily life.\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ERN\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ndividuals displaying stronger ERNs had higher GPAs, a classic measure of self-control success (Tangney, Baumeister, \u0026 Boone, 2004).\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"the monitoring processes linked to the ACC (\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"ERN\" (Robinson et al 2010:193)\n\n\"They found that a self-control depletion manipulation resulted in a smaller subsequent ERN signal in a basic cognitive task. Conceptually similar results have been reported by others (Inzlicht, McKay, \u0026 Aronson, 2006; Richeson \u0026 Shelton, 2003).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, task monitoring is sensitive to both depletion and motivational influences and may thus be a key component of whether self-control performance will be successful or not.\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"ACC serves a quite general purpose in recognizing problematic occurrences, cognitive as well as social\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Finally, there is a great deal of convergence on the importance of the ACC (the generator of the ERN: van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2002) to monitoring both unwanted cognitive and social outcomes. It is well-established that the ACC responds to error-prone contexts or actual errors (van Veen \u0026 Carter, 2006). More recently, it has been shown that the ACC responds to social rejection manipulations (Eisenberger, Lieberman, \u0026 Williams, 2003), pain (Rainville, Duncan, Price, Carrier, \u0026 Bushnell, 1997), and negative emotional events and experiences (Duncan \u0026 Barrett, 2007). Data of this type have led to the idea that the ACC serves a quite general purpose in recognizing problematic occurrences, cognitive as well as social (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005). Results of this type are further suggestive that the same ACC-dlPFC circuit is likely to be involved in both cognitive control and self-control (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"role of the ACC is conceptualized as a problem-monitor\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, the role of the ACC is conceptualized as a problem-monitor, which in turn recruits the dlPFC to do the actual work of inhibiting problematic response tendencies (Miller \u0026 Cohen, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"The first source establishes quite clearly that damage to the dlPFC results in problems in controlling habitual thoughts, feelings, motivations, and behaviors (Knight \u0026 Stuss, 2002).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Thus, if there is a brain locus of self-control, it is most clearly dependent on processes instantiated by the dlPFC (Goldberg, 2001).\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"In this cognitive control context, the five studies of Robinson (2007) are informative. He found that individuals who paused following their cognitive errors to a greater extent reported (1) higher levels of life satisfaction, (2) lower levels of depression, (3) were seen to be happier by naƒ± Ãàve observers, (4) were better capable of recognizing rewards and punishments in the environment, and (5) exhibited better abilities to inhibit dominant task sets.\" (Robinson et al 2010:194)\n\n\"Moeller and Robinson (2009) found that men, relative to women, exhibited this tendency to a lesser extent, consistent with men's greater levels of behavioral impulsivity (e.g., Eagly \u0026 Steffen, 1986).\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"Thus, a cognitive control model of self-control strength appears to have considerable value,\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"ACC to serve as an effective 'alarm' system\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"For the ACC to serve as an effective 'alarm' system (Lieberman \u0026 Eisenberger, 2005), it should remain quiescent much of the time. Otherwise, it would lose its value, much like in the 'boy who cried wolf' parable.\" (Robinson et al 2010:195)\n\n\"What Baumeister and Vohs additionally suggested was that people are motivated to preserve their self-control resources for possible future use. Thus, there may be an inverse relation between task motivation and motivation to preserve one's self-control resources.\" (Robinson et al 2010:196)\n\n\"A further question should be considered - namely, whether self-control strength can be viewed in motivational rather than capacity-related terms, a possibility hinted at by some sources of data (Moller et al., 2006; Muraven \u0026 Slessareva, 2003). Regardless, further work concerned with this motivational-capacity interface seems desirable in better understanding it.\" (Robinson et al 2010:197)\n\n---\n\n- Back Matter\n\t- published:: 2010\n\t- read:: 2015-03-07\n\n---","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.056978346Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/2013-03-10-Habit-Planning":{"title":"2013-03-10 Habit Planning","content":"up:: [[Habits MOC]]\ntags:: #log/journal\ndates:: 2013-03-10\n\n# Habit Planning\n\n## Habitual Cues\n1.

And the process of naming ‚Äúthe people‚Äù has never been a matter of genealogy and physiognomy so much as one of hierarchy. Difference in hue and hair is old. But the belief in the preeminence of hue and hair, the notion that these factors can correctly organize a society and that they signify deeper attributes, which are indelible‚Äîthis is the new idea at the heart of these new people who have been brought up hopelessly, tragically, deceitfully, to believe that they are white.\n\n---\n\u003e machinery of criminal power\n\n---\n\u003e  to be superhuman and then plead mortal error. I propose to take our countrymen‚Äôs claims of American exceptionalism seriously, which is to say I propose subjecting our country to an exceptional moral standard. This is difficult because there exists, all around us, an apparatus urging us to accept American innocence at face value and not to inquire too much\n\n---\n\u003e  I was sad. When the journalist asked me about my body, it was like she was asking me to awaken her from the most gorgeous dream.\n\n---\n\u003e skeptical of preordained American glory\n\n---\n\u003e To survive the neighborhoods and shield my body, I learned another language consisting of a basic complement of head nods and handshakes. I memorized a list of prohibited blocks. I learned the smell and feel of fighting weather. And I learned that ‚ÄúShorty, can I see your bike?‚Äù was never a sincere question, and ‚ÄúYo, you was messing with my cousin‚Äù was neither an earnest accusation nor a misunderstanding of the facts. These were the summonses that you answered with your left foot forward, your right foot back, your hands guarding your face, one slightly lower than the other, cocked like a hammer. Or they were answered by breaking out, ducking through alleys, cutting through backyards, then bounding through the door past your kid brother into your bedroom, pulling the tool out of your lambskin or from under your mattress or out of your Adidas shoebox, then calling up your own cousins (who really aren‚Äôt) and returning to that same block, on that same day, and to that same crew, hollering out, ‚ÄúYeah, nigger, what‚Äôs up now?‚Äù I recall learning these laws clearer than I recall learning my colors and shapes, because these laws were essential to the security of my body.\n\n---\n\u003e A year after I watched the boy with the small eyes pull out a gun, my father beat me for letting another boy steal from me. Two years later, he beat me for threatening my ninth-grade teacher. Not being violent enough could cost me my body. Being too violent could cost me my body. We could not get out. I was a capable boy, intelligent, well-liked, but powerfully afraid. And I felt, vaguely, wordlessly, that for a child to be marked off for such a life, to be forced to live in fear was a great injustice. And what was the source of this fear? What was hiding behind the smoke screen of streets and schools? And what did it mean that number 2 pencils, conjugations without context, Pythagorean theorems, handshakes, and head nods were the difference between life and death, were the curtains drawing down between the world and me?\n\n---\n\u003e I took a survey of Europe post-1800. I saw black people, rendered through ‚Äúwhite‚Äù eyes, unlike any I‚Äôd seen before‚Äîthe black people looked regal and human. I remember the soft face of Alessandro de‚Äô Medici, the royal bearing of Bosch‚Äôs black magi. These images, cast in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were contrasted with those created after enslavement, the Sambo caricatures I had always known. What was the difference? In my survey course of America, I‚Äôd seen portraits of the Irish drawn in the same ravenous, lustful, and simian way. Perhaps there had been other bodies, mocked, terrorized, and insecure. Perhaps the Irish too had once lost their bodies. Perhaps being named ‚Äúblack‚Äù had nothing to do with any of this; perhaps being named ‚Äúblack‚Äù was just someone‚Äôs name for being at the bottom, a human turned to object, object turned to pariah.\n\n---\n\u003e But not all of us. It must have been around that time that I discovered an essay by Ralph Wiley in which he responded to Bellow‚Äôs quip. ‚ÄúTolstoy is the Tolstoy of the Zulus,‚Äù wrote Wiley. ‚ÄúUnless you find a profit in fencing off universal properties of mankind into exclusive tribal ownership.‚Äù And there it was. I had accepted Bellow‚Äôs premise. In fact, Bellow was no closer to Tolstoy than I was to Nzinga. And if I were closer it would be because I chose to be, not because of destiny written in DNA. My great error was not that I had accepted someone else‚Äôs dream but that I had accepted the fact of dreams, the need for escape, and the invention of racecraft.\n\n---\n\u003e **She had never known her father,** which put her in the company of the greater number of everyone I‚Äôd known. I felt then that these men‚Äîthese ‚Äúfathers‚Äù‚Äîwere the greatest of cowards. But I also felt that the galaxy was playing with loaded dice, which ensured an excess of cowards in our ranks. The girl from Chicago understood this too, and she understood something more‚Äîthat all are not equally robbed of their bodies, that the bodies of women are set out for pillage in ways I could never truly know. And she was the kind of black girl who‚Äôd been told as a child that she had better be smart because her looks wouldn‚Äôt save her, and then told as a young woman that she was really pretty for a dark-skinned girl. And so there was, all about her, a knowledge of cosmic injustices, the same knowledge I‚Äôd glimpsed all those years ago watching my father reach for his belt, watching the suburban dispatches in my living room, watching the golden-haired boys with their toy trucks and football cards, and dimly perceiving the great barrier between the world and me.\n\n---\n\u003e **There was also wisdom in those streets.** I think now of the old rule that held that should a boy be set upon in someone else‚Äôs chancy hood, his friends must stand with him, and they must all take their beating together. I now know that within this edict lay the key to all living. None of us were promised to end the fight on our feet, fists raised to the sky. We could not control our enemies‚Äô number, strength, nor weaponry. Sometimes you just caught a bad one. But whether you fought or ran, you did it together, because that is the part that was in our control. What we must never do is willingly hand over our own bodies or the bodies of our friends. That was the wisdom: We knew we did not lay down the direction of the street, but despite that, we could‚Äîand must‚Äîfashion the way of our walk. And that is the deeper meaning of your name‚Äîthat the struggle, in and of itself, has meaning.\n\n---\n\u003e  I have raised you to respect every human being as singular\n\n---\n\u003e Never forget that we were enslaved in this country longer than we have been free. Never forget that for 250 years black people were born into chains‚Äîwhole generations followed by more generations who knew nothing but chains.\n\n---\n\u003e So you must wake up every morning knowing that no promise is unbreakable, least of all the promise of waking up at all. This is not despair. These are the preferences of the universe itself: verbs over nouns, actions over states, struggle over hope.\n\n---\n\u003e Love it more with every new inch I discover. But you are a black boy, and you must be responsible for your body in a way that other boys cannot know. Indeed, you must be responsible for the worst actions of other black bodies, which, somehow, will always be assigned to you. And you must be responsible for the bodies of the powerful‚Äîthe policeman who cracks you with a nightstick will quickly find his excuse in your furtive movements. And this is not reducible to just you‚Äîthe women around you must be responsible for their bodies in a way that you never will know.\n\n---\n\u003e You have to make your peace with the chaos, but you cannot lie. You cannot forget how much they took from us and how they transfigured our very bodies into sugar, tobacco, cotton, and gold.\n\n---\n\u003e  I heard several people ask for forgiveness for the officer who‚Äôd shot Prince Jones down. I only vaguely recall my impressions of all this. But I know that I have always felt great distance from the grieving rituals of my people, and I must have felt it powerfully then. The need to forgive the officer would not have moved me, because even then, in some inchoate form, I knew that Prince was not killed by a single officer so much as he was murdered by his country and all the fears that have marked it from birth.\n\n---\n\u003e Perhaps you remember that time we went to see Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle on the Upper West Side. You were almost five years old. The theater was crowded, and when we came out we rode a set of escalators down to the ground floor. As we came off, you were moving at the dawdling speed of a small child. A white woman pushed you and said, ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù Many things now happened at once. There was the reaction of any parent when a stranger lays a hand on the body of his or her child. And there was my own insecurity in my ability to protect your black body. And more: There was my sense that this woman was pulling rank. I knew, for instance, that she would not have pushed a black child out on my part of Flatbush, because she would be afraid there and would sense, if not know, that there would be a penalty for such an action. But I was not out on my part of Flatbush. And I was not in West Baltimore. And I was far from The Mecca. I forgot all of that. I was only aware that someone had invoked their right over the body of my son. I turned and spoke to this woman, and my words were hot with all of the moment and all of my history. She shrunk back, shocked. A white man standing nearby spoke up in her defense. I experienced this as his attempt to rescue the damsel from the beast. He had made no such attempt on behalf of my son. And he was now supported by other white people in the assembling crowd. The man came closer. He grew louder. I pushed him away. He said, ‚ÄúI could have you arrested!‚Äù I did not care. I told him this, and the desire to do much more was hot in my throat. This desire was only controllable because I remembered someone standing off to the side there, bearing witness to more fury than he had ever seen from me‚Äîyou.\n\u003e I came home shook. It was a mix of shame for having gone back to the law of the streets mixed with rage‚Äî‚ÄúI could have you arrested!‚Äù Which is to say: ‚ÄúI could take your body.‚Äù\n\n---\n\u003e The man ranted on. When the officers turned away, he ranted more to the group of black men assembled who‚Äôd been hired to sit his family out on the street. His manner was like all the powerless black people I‚Äôd ever known, exaggerating their bodies to conceal a fundamental plunder that they could not prevent.\n\n---\n\u003e A few weeks into our stay, I made a friend who wanted to improve his English as much as I wanted to improve my French. We met one day out in the crowd in front of Notre Dame. We walked to the Latin Quarter. We walked to a wine shop. Outside the wine shop there was seating. We sat and drank a bottle of red. We were served heaping piles of meats, bread, and cheese. Was this dinner? Did people do this? I had not even known how to imagine it. And more, was this all some elaborate ritual to get an angle on me? My friend paid. I thanked him. But when we left I made sure he walked out first. He wanted to show me one of those old buildings that seem to be around every corner in that city. And the entire time he was leading me, I was sure he was going to make a quick turn into an alley, where some dudes would be waiting to strip me of‚Ä¶what, exactly? But my new friend simply showed me the building, shook my hand, gave a fine bonne soir√©e, and walked off into the wide open night.

It occurred to us that all new information or ideas must support, extend, or challenge existing ideas or information you already have and that has led to those verbs being cognitive tools for students‚Äù Bob Bain\n\n%%\nThis effort to encourage active, engaged thinking relates to the mindset behind Evergreen notes, namely that [[Evergreen notes compound in value over time]].\n%%\n\n---\n\"Years ago, we were working on an R\u0026D project in curriculum with high school students in Detroit. The students ‚Äúread‚Äù texts just as I did when I was in high school ‚Äì skimming it to find sentences to copy to ‚Äúanswer‚Äù teacher assigned or questions at back of text. I don‚Äôt think I ever read a complete chapter while a high school student, simply skimmed and copied enough to get me a check or a ‚ÄúC‚Äù. No active reader or thinker I, but active skimmer! I ‚Äústudented‚Äù my way through high school, not learning much. And we were seeing ‚Äústudenting‚Äù among students with whom we were working.\n\nWe puzzled over what made more thoughtful, active readers and started tracking briefly our ‚Äúno-longer-studenting‚Äù reading practices. We concluded that before reading something we had some theory or conjecture about what we‚Äôd find there, no matter how vague or na√Øve. Then, what we were reading either ‚Äúsupported‚Äù or ‚Äúextended‚Äù or \"challenged‚Äô our pre-reading ideas.\n\nNo great insight, really, as others like Piaget had asserted similar things in a far more nuanced language (assimilation/ assimilating and accommodation/accommodating ).\n\nHowever, my colleagues and I wondered if we could turn those thinking verbs ‚Äì support, extend, challenge ‚Äì into cognitive tools students could use to do less studenting and more thinking when reading.\n\nSo, we trialed a new approach to assigned reading in our R\u0026D work:\n\n1. Asked students first for a freewrite conjecture about the topic so students could see what they thought.\n2. Then assigned reading by asking students to identify or explain how the text ‚Äúsupported,‚Äù ‚Äúextended‚Äù or ‚Äúchallenged‚Äù their thinking.\n\nTurned out to have some power. Students began to look at texts in relation to their thinking and not some pre-packaged questions teachers asked.\n\nWe‚Äôve used this in every curricular project since (about 18 years of it). I use in my own teaching, often employing those verbs when reading multiple texts (e.g., how does Dewey‚Äôs essay support, extend, or challenge piece by Thorndike? In what ways do they support, extend, or challenge your thinking about learning?)\n\nOn last thing: I use those verbs in my re-purposing my notes when working in earnest on a problem I need to write about or teach. The verbs become ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù tags that define a relationship among notes or ideas ‚Äì these support each other, or extend each other, or challenge each other.\"","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.056978346Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/2020-08-01":{"title":"2020-08-01","content":"#log/journal \n\nI guess it was a good idea to share my ideas with others.

Below is a list of benefits derived from having your notes equipped with fluid frameworks like a **Home note** and **Maps of Content**.\n\n---\n## Benefits\n###### Provides Reliability\nHaving a Home note and MOCs act as reliable home bases to re-ground your thoughts whenever they begin to waver. Like a parent to a five-year old, linked frameworks like MOCs are a consistent and comforting safety net. \n \nDisregard this at your own peril.  [^1]\n\n\n### Provides Flexibility\n\u003e [[Fluid Frameworks]] like the Home note and Maps of Content *don't limit access; they curate it.* \n\nThey are like a top-notch concierge that directs you to where you want to be. \n\nSee [[Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea]].\n\n#### Launches the Brain \nThe LYT framework is filled with your personalized reminders of important categories of knowledge and their key terms. It helps kickstart the brain‚Äîreducing the activation energy needed to start thinking and connecting ideas.\n\n##### Enhances Note Retrieval\nNote retrieval becomes easier when you're staring at many possible access points: your main categories, contexts, maps, and tags. [^2] Notes become tethered like Wolverine:\n![[wolverine-tethered.jpg]]\n\n### Alleviates Overwhelm\n[[MOCs Overview]] (MOCs) are your key to adding structure to the chaos, especially as your digital library grows. The ability to sense the tickle of anxiety and build an MOC is oftentimes the difference between a finished project and an abandoned one.\n\n### Encourages Relational, Positional Thinking \n***Making a Map of Content forces a rich, engaging relational battle between notes.*** Notes jockey for position in your brain, and each placement by you embeds them with additional meaning.\n\n### Aids in Linking with Pre-built Contexts\nYour 10 or so [[Figuring out your Home MOCs|main maps]] provide a pre-built latticework upon which to hang your new notes. It's a personalized classification system for your digital knowledge. Tethering to these hub-like maps vastly enhance long-term storage and retrieval.\n\n### Future-Proofs for your Future Self\nThere are months that go by where I don't open my digital library. Before adopting plain text and adding structure, I would get anxiety when I would finally re-open it. Now, however, I don't get that anxiety because I have my trusty **Home note**, **Maps of Content** and other fluid ways of categorizing and retrieving info. In no time, I'm back up to speed and off to the races.\n\n### Improves Memory\n![[Reps#^dbdd21]]\n\nBecause of the well-traveled structural pathways that the Home note and Maps of Content encourage, my recall has improved. This makes sense because of three important factors that working with \"linked frameworks\" encourages:\n\n1. [[Reps]] - I'm constantly returning to a home view and then re-launching into new directions in my digital library. \n2. Conceptual Thinking - Making MOCs forces you to really consider the unique qualities of the thought you're holding and how it relates to other thoughts. This conceptual `[[thinking through linking]]` strengthens neural connections‚Äîmaking [[Cobwebs into Cables]].\n3. [[Spatial Context]] - Your main MOCs are numbered and always at the top of the sidebar (when sorted A to Z). This way, they act as a spatial map. We remember things much better when we have a *spatial constellation* of related things. \n\n### Increases Satisfaction\nWe spend too much time with our notes not to experience joy with them. ==LYT structures allow you to fly around your digital library with the deftness of a surgeon and the joy of a chimpanzee swinging from branch to branch.== \n\n%%\n\n---\nDid you know this article is LIVE online right now, but no one online can see these hidden \"comments\" except us :)\n\nWow, this note uses at least 18 different formatting methods:\n\n```\ninternal links, embeds, headers, dividers, emphasis with bolds, italics, bold+italics, lists, images, piped links, external links, blockquotes, inline code, tables, strikethroughs, highlights, footnotes, and comments. \n```\n\n## The first three benefits as a table\n| Benefit              | Description                               |\n| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| Provides Reliability | Reliable places to ground thoughts        |\n| Provides Flexibility | Fluid frameworks don't limit, they curate |\n| Launches the Brain   | ~~Jump~~ Kickstarts your brain                     | \n\n%%\n\n---\n## Next\nThe benefits are exhaustive‚Äîand we haven't even talked about [Idea Emergence](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1317190776284086272)!\n\nBut you may still be asking: [[Is LYT For Me]]?\n\n\n[^1]: Do not underestimate the peace of mind that comes from a reliable, dependable digital library. Being unable to access something you know you have is basically a form of \"Digital Dementia\". \n[^2]: I like to make my digital library super robust. That means I have several avenues built-in to re-discover a note. I find this process of \"connecting to conceptual cousins\" further cements each idea into my memory. It sort of tethers things in place like Wolverine, or if you prefer, like a bug caught on a spider web.

A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and a 12-time NBA All-Star, he was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty that won 11 NBA championships during his 13-year career.[2] Russell and Henri Richard of the National Hockey League are tied for the record of the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.[3] Russell is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He led the San Francisco Dons to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956,[4] and he captained the gold-medal winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.[5]\n\nDespite his limitations on offense, as Russell averaged 15.1 points per game, his rebounding, defense, and leadership made him one of the dominant players of his era.[6][7][8][9] Standing at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) arm span,[10][11] his shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics' dominance during his career. Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities, and he led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds,[12] and remains second all time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game.[13]\n\nRussell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966‚Äì69) stint as player-coach for the Celtics, becoming the first black coach in the NBA and the first to win a championship.[14] In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the civil rights movement.[15]\n\nRussell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, was one of the founding inductees into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[5] one of only four players to receive all three honors, and selected into the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. In 2009, the NBA renamed the NBA Finals MVP Award in his honor.[16] In 2021, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a second time for his coaching career.[17] Shortly after his death in 2022, the NBA retired Russell's jersey number 6 league-wide, becoming the only player in NBA history to receive the honor.[18] ","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.060978536Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Bottom-up-thinking":{"title":"Bottom-up thinking","content":"up:: [[Idea Emergence (defn)]]\ntags:: #on/thinking \n\n# Bottom-up thinking\n**Bottom-up thinking** is where your thinking is driven by encountering ideas and connecting/developing them organically. \n\nPRO: Allows for emergent thinking.\nCON: Can feel a little too chaotic at times. \n\nSee: [[Idea Emergence (defn)]]","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.060978536Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Cabin":{"title":"Cabin","content":"# Cabin ü™µ\n\nThe cabin is my epicenter.\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nIt's where I go to ground myself ü™®.\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nIt's where I go to truly orient myself üß≠ .\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nAnd it's where I visit for spiritual centering üß≤.\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nI am connected here ‰∑§.\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nAnd I am in no rush to leave...\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nBut when I am...\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\n‚Ä¢\n\nI might hike over to the [[Life Map]].\n\n  \n\n%% tags:: #map %%","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.060978536Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Carl-Sagan-kit":{"title":"Carl Sagan (kit)","content":"up:: [[People MOC]]\ntags:: #people\ndates:: 1934 - 1996\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]+ Notes on this note\n\u003e This is a sanitized version of my actual note. \n\u003e - Some content and links have been removed.\n\n# Carl Sagan\nCarl Sagan has earned my highest praise out of basically anyone I know.\n\nWhen I think of Carl Sagan, I think of [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (kit)]].

This is because learning and maintaining habits happens in the *basal ganglia*, a part of your brain that can function normally even if the rest of your brain is damaged.\n\nUnfortunately, this resilience means that even if you kick a bad habit, like smoking, you will always be at risk of relapsing.\n\nHabits are simple cue-routine-reward loops that save effort and therefore endure. They are [[Natural Selection]] in action. See: [[Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage]].\n\n**Habits stick because they create craving.**\n\n- golden rule of changing any habit: don‚Äôt resist craving, redirect it\n\t- do this by keeping the cue and the reward and just replacing the routine.\n\nWhat Keystone Habits are really about, and probably why I've always struggled with the term, [^1] is because behavioral change is *really* driven by small wins‚Äîie early victories that are relatively easy to reach. Therefore it's \"small wins\" and not \"keystone habits\" that help you viscerally believe that change is possible.\n\nWhat Duhigg‚Äîand over 500 research articles who referenced Baumeister's work‚Äîgot wrong: \"Willpower is the most important keystone habit.\" No, it's not. This finding, which is false, directed my attentions for the next several years, only to realize that willpower is way, way overrated and the studies were rotten (looking at you Baumeister!).\n\n**Following habits is not only a key part of our lives but also a key part of organizations and companies. All habits comprise a cue-routine-reward loop, and the easiest way to change this is to substitute the routine for something else while keeping the cue and reward the same. Achieving lasting change in life is difficult, but it can be done by focusing on important keystone habits such as willpower.**\n\n[^1]: Too simple perhaps, because in making the process super sticky with only 3 steps, he left out an important fourth step between Cue and Routine: Craving.

That's because it forces you to really think about what you're trying to say. However, these \"clear opinions\" need \"clear things\" to talk about! What are these \"things\"?\n\n\"THINGS\" like:\n- *Concepts*: which can and should stand on their own\n- *Known Things*: \"The magna carta was signed in 1215\"\n- *Standards*: Things with a pre-set language (whether that's programming, Things that follow a process, manuals, etc\n\t- examples include anything from mathematical formulas, to the basics of language, to the process of putting a bike together\n- *Definitions, terms, topics, persons, places, or generally any other nouns.\n\nThese THING-based notes will naturally spawn ideas of your own that have clear opinions (or statements). For example:\n- The note on the `[[Magna Carta]]` (Clear Thing) can then link to a personalized note titled `[[No one is above the law]]` (Clear Opinion), which could link to another note titled `[[Protests can invoke radical change]]` (Clear Opinion).\n- A note on `[[Defining a variable]]` (Clear Thing) can link to a personalized note on `[[Understanding variables leads to higher level thinking]]` (Clear Opinion).\n- A note on the concept `[[Like begets like]]` (kinda both Clear Opinion and Fact) can link to the opinion `[[The neural formation of habits are additive]]` (Clear Opinion) and a bunch of other notes. See this example below:\n\n![[lyt-note-links-to-other-notes.png]]\n\nIn this way, Thing-based notes are sturdy dots that we can then connect to Opinion-based notes through the natural process of note-making.\n\nThis is one of my [[Strong opinions, weakly held]].\n\n---\n### Extra commentary\nThere seem to be \"things\" and \"opinion about things\", and it's nice to have both. The \"things\" act as pillars of‚Äîor waypoints to‚Äîacquired knowledge. Guiding markers and reminders. The things are the latticework upon which our \"opinions about things\" can hang. I suspect a healthy PKM system needs a balance of both.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.060978536Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Evergreen-notes-compound-in-value-over-time":{"title":"Evergreen notes compound in value over time","content":"up:: [[Evergreen notes]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n\u003e [!NOTE]+ Notes on this note\n\u003e This is a sanitized version of my actual note. \n\u003e - Some content and links have been removed.\n\n# Evergreen notes compound in value over time\nWhen you follow a process for making evergreen notes, you naturally develop insights that compound in value over time.

O2 levels increase. CO2 levels decrease. pH levels increase (and surprisingly stay higher than what‚Äôs normal even after breath-holding, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe they are associated with pH drops.\n\nO2:CO2 Ratio \u0026 pH Levels:\n- A normal ratio is 4:1 \u0026 pH: 7.40\n- During hyperventilation, the ratio goes up to 11:1 \u0026 pH: 7.70\n- During hypoventilation, the ratio goes down to 1:1 \u0026 pH: 7.50\n\nInteresting note: Even after breath-holding, pH levels stay surprisingly higher than normal, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe the detriments that are talked about are always associated with drops in pH. Hence, if pH stays above normal, all should be good. I‚Äôd love to get some expert opinions on this.\n* [Research Link](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full)\n\nLactate Levels:\n- A normal range is 0.5 - 1.5 mmol/L. The test subject‚Äôs baseline was 0.70.\n- During hyperventilation, it only increased to 1.15 mmol/L.\n- During hypoventilation, it lowered to 0.90 mmol/L.\n\nFor comparison a 15-45 second sprint shows lactate levels rising way up to 8-15 mmol/L. So, there is no worry for the minuscule rise in lactate levels from hyper-hypoventilation.\n* [Research Link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2007391)\n\n### Benefit # 1: POSITIVE HORMONAL RESPONSE AND A (SUPPOSED) INCREASED IMMUNE SYSTEM.\nThis act stimulates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline (just like taking a cold shower, which also forces us to hyperventilate a bit), and has been shown to benefit the immune system.\n\n### Benefit # 2: MINDFULNESS\nBoth conscious \"over-breathing\" and the conscious breath-holding act as a fast and simple form of mindfulness for me, getting me out of racing thoughts in the prefrontal cortex, and‚Äîdue to the hormonal release‚Äîallowing my brain stem and more primitive parts of the brain (such as the pituitary gland) to activate without invoking worry and stress (I admit things get unclear for me here, so I'd like to hear more on this). Regardless, I‚Äôm more calm, centered, and clear-minded afterwards.\n\n### Benefit # 3: EUPHORIC FEELING\nBreathing in excess O2 leads to tingling fingers and lightheadedness. It also creates a slightly euphoric feeling. Is that weird?\n\n## PART 2\nThen after elevating my O2 levels, that‚Äôs when I hold my breath, which I imagine completely moves the O2:CO2 ratio in the opposite relationship ‚Äî like a seesaw. And in the process, it leads to:\n\n### Benefit # 4: WILLPOWER BOOST\nIt gives a sense of control. And my belief is that a SENSE of control is a main factor in willpower and happiness. (Whether or not we really have any real control is a separate debate.) Since this odd activity increases my sense of control, it increases my sense of happiness.\n\n### Benefit # 5: ANTI-FRAGILITY\nStressing the mind and body (safely) leads to the overcompensation effect. That‚Äôs why we adapt to heavy weights by getting stronger (to throw out a common example).\n\n## Major Concern\nDoes this pattern of Hyperventilation/Retention cause any harm? There are a few studies covering Wim Hof and his method that show clear results (see below), but much more research is needed.\n\nAnybody have other takes, insights, research, commentary, or suggestions on this?\n\nResearch Link [:](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full) [http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full)\n\n---\n\n*Note on Lactate Levels*\nLactic acid is a product of cell metabolism that can accumulate when cells lack sufficient oxygen (hypoxia) and must turn to a less efficient means of energy production, or when a condition causes excess production or impaired clearance of lactate.\n\nDepending on pH, it is sometimes present in the form of lactic acid.

Here is an example of each:\n\n1. \"I'm Anxious, I'm feeling confused.\" Do I know what to focus on right now? Am I doing the thing I should be doing right now? If this is the issue, then my Direction isn't solid. How can I improve my clarity about what to do? How can I reduce the amount of competing actions to take?\n2. \"I'm Anxious, my mind is scattered.\" What's my environment like; am I getting interrupted too much? If so, then my Attention is suffering. How can I reduce the intensity and frequency of these distractions?\n3. \"I'm not excited about anything, I'm apathetic.\" I need to reconnect to some Enthusiasm. What gets me excited or motivated? How can I reconnect with that?\n4. \"I'm tired, I have a headache, everything feels like too much.\" Why are my Energy levels down? What needs to be improved out of the following: quality of sleep, diet, exercise, leisure time, and/or relationships?\n\n## Four Factors of Flow\n\nI have found that using the Flow Map to find your current State of Mind is a valuable exercise to improving it. Equally valuable is using it to find any glaring weaknesses in the elements that help create a good State of Mind. I have found that there are essentially [[Four Factors of Flow]]. They are: [[Direction (re Flow)]], [[Attention (re Flow)]], [[Enthusiasm (re Flow)]], and [[Energy (re Flow)]]. The best way to improve your experience is to identify what you're lacking, and then taking actions to strengthen that area.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.060978536Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Fluid-Frameworks":{"title":"Fluid Frameworks","content":"up:: [[LYT Kit]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n# Fluid Frameworks\n*Fluid frameworks are non-rigid, highly-flexible organizing structures that you can use as needed.* When we talk about fluid frameworks in the \"Linking Your Thinking\" System, we're mainly referring to higher-order notes like MOCs and the Home note (but a balanced use of MOCs, folders, tags, and queries can also maintain a fluid structure).\n\nFluid frameworks are not mutually exclusive.

If you're in Flow, it's because these factors are doing well. If you are not in flow, then at least one factor isn't doing well.\n\n![[flow-four-factors.png]]\n\n### Main Factors Governing the Strength of Each\n\n1. [[Direction (re Flow)]] ‚Äî *Level of Clarity; Amount of Directions* ‚Äî Aside from \"Nature \u0026 Nurture\" (which is a philosophical rabbit hole), it's the Level of Clarity and Amount of Directions (i.e. the number of goals one has) that most govern the strength of Direction.\n2. [[Attention (re Flow)]] ‚Äî *Distractions in both Frequency and Intensity* ‚Äî This is most governed by Distractions: the Intensity of Distractions and the Frequency of Distractions.\n3. [[Enthusiasm (re Flow)]] ‚Äî *Level of Desire* ‚Äî This also ties into \"Nature \u0026 Nurture\" a bit. It might sound circular, but one's Level of Desire dictates one's Enthusiasm. It's the most intangible. What excites somebody? What inspires them, motivates them, fills them with passion? I'm not sure how to best affect one's Enthusiasm. It's the \"Why\" in the world of \"Goal Setting.\" It's very personal to each person, but some commonalities are usually: to be stimulated and engaged, to feel important, to feel the work is important, to improve one's financial situation.\n4. [[Energy (re Flow)]] ‚Äî *Quality of Sleep, Diet, \u0026 Exercise; Quality of Relationships \u0026 Community; Quality of Leisure Time* ‚Äî also Hydration, Sunlight, Nature, Hobbies, etc. \n\n### How They Impact Each Other\n\n- If **Direction** is clear and not diluted, then it's easier to focus one's Attention; Enthusiasm isn't diluted; Energy isn't wasted.\n- If **Attention** isn't spread too thin amid myriad distractions, then it's easier to [[stay-on-target.jpg|stay on target]] in the ideal Direction; Enthusiasm isn't diluted; Energy isn't wasted.\n- If **Enthusiasm** is strong, then it's easier to stay committed to one's Direction; it's easier to maintain one's Attention; it's easier to compensate for middling Energy levels.\n- If **Energy** is cultivated, then your Direction seems possible/doable/easier; You can more easily maintain your Attention; you can get work done even when you're not feeling Enthusiasm (and through the process of doing the work, you can usually create *new* Enthusiasm).\n  - If you have a [[Poor Diet]] (not included in the LYT Kit), then your Attention is going to suck: you'll be more easily distracted; so you'll spend time in other Directions; and thus you'll dilute and dissipate your Enthusiasm. This one is a huge component that you can control. You can replace \"Poor Diet\" with \"Lack of Sleep\" and you'll get similar results.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.060978536Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Four-Virtues":{"title":"Four Virtues","content":"up:: [[FlowCreation MOC]]\ntags:: #on/Living \n\n# Four Virtues\nI have found that a better way to look at Virtues is less as Values and more as \"Abilities,\" because it implies that it's not enough to value something, you have to be skilled in it. \n\nOut of many schools of thought, I have found that using the Stoic Virtues as a base, aligned the best with my way of thinking.

The system and process. Yep, makes me this of my ode to The Process, see [[Trust the process (kit)]].\n- Habits are the fundamental unit of your systems. Your current systems are perfectly designed to provide you with your current results.\n\nJames adds a fourth step to Duhigg's habit cycle, which was needed. James is a smart dude. Check out the steps here: [[Understanding the habit cycle and habitual cues]].\n\nOther tidbits:\n- The first step is Awareness. Discover and record your habits throughout the day. Here's an example of me [[Charting out habit cycles in my life circa 2013]]\n\t- The more specific the implementation, the more motivation, ie time, place, etc\n- Focus on Identity over Outcome: ie \"I'm the guy who...\" over thinking about the result I want...Every action you take is you casting a vote for your identity.\n- James shares 'The Goldilocks rule', which is nothing more than finding [[Flow]] through balancing challenge with ability, which apparently is 3-4% beyond your current ability. You need victories to stay satisfied, but you need to be challenged. \n\n\u003e \"Men desire novelty to such a degree that men who are doing well require it just as much as men who are not.\"\n\nAh yes, \"novelty\".

The best version is in the LYT Curriculum.\n\u003e \n\n# In what ways can we form useful relationships between notes?\nAre you into personal knowledge management (PKM)? Are you confused about when to use a **folder** versus a **tag** versus a **link** versus a **Map of Content**? Let‚Äôs explore each ‚Äúrelationship-builder‚Äù and how we can use them expertly.\n\n_Main Ideas_\n\n*   Top-down categorizing has gotten a bad rap. It has a place.\n*   Bottom-up creating is great, but it needs a bit of top-down structure as your library grows. But using just folders is the WRONG way.\n*   **Maps of Contents (MOCs)** are game-changers.\n\nA flat structure of notes ‚Äî i.e. one big folder ‚Äî is ‚Äúfrictionless‚Äù. There is no thinking ‚Äúnow where exactly does this go?‚Äù However, over time it becomes messy and overwhelming. To overcome the chaos, we need to build healthy, flexible frameworks that can grow with our knowledge over time.\n\nLet‚Äôs examine the known‚Äî and lesser known ‚Äî ways we form useful relationships between notes.\n\n### Direct Links\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1408/1*SMU0M-iBKedBR6PwUKrayw.png)\n\nDirect links are the strongest type of relationship. They are the purest and most explicit way of connecting two notes. This is the core method of growing a healthy, dynamic zettelkasten.\n\nDespite the proclamations, direct links alone are not enough. They do not allow for easy, dependable high-level navigation. They are a system of streets connecting one block to another. But sometimes you want to zoom out and view the map.\n\n### Folders\nFolders are rigid and exclusionary by their nature. Whatever is in a folder lives separated from the main collection. It‚Äôs a rigid hierarchy that imposes order. Without special workarounds this limits note accessibility, discourages interdisciplinary thinking, and stunts the long-term growth of a complex and interesting Zettelkasten.\n\nThere are some strategic uses for folders, but their overuse may be a sign that the user is uncomfortable with other, arguably better methods of building relationships between notes while maintaining the long-term health of their digital library. If you have some quixotic notion about creating a digital library that acts as an interesting conversation partner ‚Äî folders don‚Äôt make it as easy.\n\nWhat about for projects? Depending on the use cases, a person might like using folders for projects.\n\n*   If your goal is to manage projects, folders are great ‚Äî maybe even ideal. You might decide that you want your projects to be actively walled-off units.\n*   But once they are final, you would need to take the extra steps of reformulating any good stuff into your main digital library.\n\nA possible use for a folder is as a temporary inbox, or ‚Äúincubation‚Äù folder. As long as you view these research streams as temporary staging grounds, to be deleted or assimilated with the Borg- er, I mean, your main-brain-frame; you should be fine. Otherwise, that inbox folder can get awfully crufty.\n\nAnother possible use for folders would be for ‚Äúvery clearly defined‚Äù notes. For example, things like: Images, People, Quotes, and Source Materials (things written by other people). You don‚Äôt have to use these folders; you could easily add their contents into the main vault; but you might find it keeps things slightly more tidy.\n\nBut know this: retreating too much into project-based folder management will cripple your long-term thinking partner (i.e., your zettelkasten) from growing complex, dynamic, and interesting cross-genre connections. You won‚Äôt have a zettelkasten, you‚Äôll have a collection of silo-ed folders. Those are massive costs to consider.\n\nThat said, limiting accessibility may be ideal for private information like finances, health, and private journaling. Then a folder is the perfect instrumental to intentionally cordon off those notes from the rest.\n\n### Tags\nTags are relatively weak associations, but don‚Äôt discount them. They are easy ways to quickly filter large swathes of notes. Tags are more fluid: one note can have multiple tags. The problem is that _tags alone don‚Äôt scale_.\n\nSay you have a `#PermanentNote` tag or tag page. Whenever you take notes on something you read or watch, you apply that tag. It‚Äôs great when only 50 notes have that tag. It‚Äôs far less useful when 500 notes have that tag.\n\n#### Multiple Tags\nA partial solution is to use multiple tags, so you can search for: `#PermanentNote` `#habit` to filter in only those results.\n\n\u003e But the problem here is that you have to remember each tag!\n\nWhat happens when you can‚Äôt remember that when you‚Äôre tagging a new note? You end up using `#improvement` or something else. Sure, maybe you can remember this single `#habit` example. But over time you‚Äôll lose track of how to tag a new note in a way you can reliably retrieve (meaning that it will scale well and you‚Äôll remember it). By the way, software that allows for ‚Äústarred‚Äù notes is just exercising a form of tagging.\n\n#### Tags with Saved Boolean Search\nSaved Searches are another partial and robust solution. You can save a tag search like `#PermanentNote` AND `#habit`.\n\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/764/1*uCSHtOqZCE3izP1-l_6RUQ.png)\n\n#### Using Tags for Chronological Searches\nTags also work well in the temporal context. Here are some tags that work well as a search when your notes have timestamps:  `#journal | #writing ; #people | #waiting | #log/meeting ; #health | #workout ; and even #source`\n\n### Proximity\nEveryone tends to forget how we use the proximity between notes to build relationships. Organizing by proximity can be weak and arbitrary (airplane flight sitting next to total strangers) or strong and meaningful (airplane flight next to your family). It just depends on what level you apply it. There are 3 basic levels of proximity.\n\n1.  **Organizing by Proximity in the main folder:**\n\n*   _Alphabetical_: Sure ‚ÄúApple‚Äù and ‚ÄúBanana‚Äù start next to each other and hold a strong relationship. But over time that proximity will change; because years later the list looks like ‚ÄúApple‚Äù, ‚Äúaqua‚Äù, ‚Äúaqualung‚Äù, ‚Äúarabesque‚Äù, ‚Äúarachne‚Äù, ‚Äúarbiter‚Äù, ‚Äúarc‚Äù, ‚Äúarena‚Äù, ‚Äúaries‚Äù, ‚Äúarise‚Äù, ‚ÄúArkansas‚Äù, ‚ÄúBanana‚Äù. So relationships that start out strong can weaken over time.\n\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/586/1*uzcKVhnrPyQ6bNNwEuCP6Q.png)\n\n*   _Chronological:_ If you sort by creation date, the proximities between notes won‚Äôt change but they are inherently more arbitrary (random), except for their temporal context (which holds varying value depending on the context).\n\n**2\\. Organizing by Proximity in the same subfolder:**\n\n*   Notes in the same subfolder will have a closer relationship since they are grouped in the same vicinity. But this comes at the cost of being silo-ed from the rest of the note library.\n\n**3\\. Organizing by Proximity in an MOC (Map of Content):**\n\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/930/1*_2jKjcURnsgnTmDCZWspuA.png)\n\n*   Notes in the same MOC are very likely to be closely related, especially after they are manually sorted in some form of relational positioning. This is the best way to apply the power of proximity.\n\nUsing just a single note, you can identify and build relationships between notes.\n\n### Map of Contents (MOC)\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2856/1*-zaTKc2p6Bv_lGR7DCwHmQ.png)\n\nAn MOC is just a note ‚Äî a very special type of note. It uses proximity effectively and acts like a tag and a non-exclusive folder at the same time.\n\n*   Tag-like: It groups the links of associated notes in a non-exclusive way. (The notes themselves live freely elsewhere.)\n*   Folder-like: It assembles notes in a tightly-packed grouping.\n*   Proximity: It grants you the ability to deliberately position each note in relation to the other notes.\n\n\u003e In this way, MOCs don‚Äôt limit access, they **curate** it ‚Äî while keeping your notes free.\n\nUsing MOCs is like being in your own warehouse full of workbenches, where each workbench contains a selection of highly curated index cards for you to engage with.\n\nAnother way to consider MOCs is through emergence.\n\n\u003e MOCs are Evergreen notes, just at the next level of emergence.\n\nIn an MOC, the party is always happening. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúroom where it happens.‚Äù Individual notes can ‚Äúshadow-clone‚Äù themselves and essentially be in multiple parties simultaneous ‚Äî interacting and developing complexity from each party at the same time!\n\n_Q: How do MOCs compare to TOCs (Table of Contents)?_\n\nA: Whereas MOCs are fluid, TOCs are rigid. This is by design. A table of contents is for assembling a specific and linear order. MOCs serve much broader purposes. Oftentimes an MOC can morph into a TOC as a project starts to finalize.\n\n### A Home Note\n![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2418/1*XDjhBzNev_j-6EnXRFoc3Q.png)\n\nThink of your Home note as the highest-level of your zettelkasten / digital library. It has links to the main MOCs in your library along with your most relevant tags.\n\nIt is an excellent access point because it encourages you to focus on the areas in your life that you‚Äôve deemed as important.\n\nA Home note creates stronger, longer-lasting connections, especially as one‚Äôs library grows far beyond 1000 notes.\n\n### Don‚Äôt fall for the dogma\nUntil recently, folders were all we had. They weren‚Äôt good enough. Now we have links. Now many people have taken a hard stance that all they need are links. Hard stances become fragile stances. Don‚Äôt fall for the dogma. The right tools for a healthy digital library include a multitude of relationship-builders.\n\nThese relationship-builders include: a Home note. Maps of Content. Direct Links. Proximity. Tags.\n\nAnd yes, even a few folders.\n\n---\n\n- Back Matter\n\t- dates:: 2020-08-08\n\t- published:: 2020-08-08\n\n---","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.060978536Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Inbox":{"title":"Inbox","content":"up:: [[Home]]\ntags:: #map/view \n\n# The Inbox\nThis isn't a normal inbox.

In this constant buzz of noise-feces, we lose touch with more than just our goals; we lose touch with ourselves - our intuition, our *own* thoughts, our voice, our *own* opinion, and the very sense of individuality that makes each of us unique. This is an invisible war for the soul, and we are losing ‚Äî badly. By all external measures we can claim freedom, yet in the place where it matters most, in our ability to think and question and act on our own volition, we have unwittingly given up our minds to be shackled by the forces of outside stimuli. Stimuli that tells us how to think, that manipulates our emotions, making us incredulously angry at someone or some issue we've never met or likely don't truly understand, and telling us how to feel about it, and giving us talking points for what to share about it. The low-hanging fruit of distraction is tempting, especially when our guard is down or our willpower is low. At these moments, we unconsciously and voluntarily relinquish the rights to our minds to the loudest megaphone. We willingly allow our mind to be hijacked. We place our head in the scabbard, we lock the gate and forget the key, we sleepwalk into slavery - a prison for the mind.\n\nHopefully now it's clear that the Morning Journal is a fight for control over your life, because it's a battle for your mind. It's a fight for your authenticity. It's a war for the very essence of who you are. It reconnects you to you. It gets you back in touch with the most important voice you need to be listening to: yourself. \n\nNext step: [[Writing down daily goals in the morning is an important habit]]\n\n---\n\n- Back Matter\n\t- dates:: 2014-06-28\n\t- created:: 2014-06-28\n\t- modified:: 2020-05-28\n\n---","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.060978536Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/K.-Anders-Ericsson-kit":{"title":"K.

Anders Ericsson\nMade popular the term [[Deliberate Practice]], along with Malcolm Gladwell.\n\n\n### Wiki\n\u003e **K. Anders Ericsson** (October, 23, 1947 ‚Äì June 17, 2020) was a Swedish psychologist and Conradi Eminent Scholar and Professor of Psychology at Florida State University who was internationally recognized as a researcher in the psychological nature of expertise and human performance.\n\u003e\n\u003e Ericsson studied expert performance in domains such as medicine, music, chess, and sports, focusing exclusively on extended deliberate practice  (e.g., high concentration practice beyond one's comfort zone) as a means of how expert performers acquire their superior performance. Critically, Ericsson's program of research served as a direct complement to other research that addresses cognitive ability, personality, interests, and other factors that help researchers understand and predict deliberate practice and expert performance.\n\u003e\n\u003e [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.%20Anders%20Ericsson)","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/LYT-FAQ":{"title":"LYT FAQ","content":"up:: [[LYT Kit]] \ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n# LYT FAQ\n\n- **So now I have to manage MOCs?**\n\t- Don't let the LYT, MOCs or anything become an \"I have to\" situation. You don't *have* to do anything. You don't have to make any map. Just go about your business of making notes for life. \n\t- The MOC will just hang out. You don't have to tend to it. There are no tasks to manage. You could never open your home note and MOCs for a whole year and they will be fine. Then on Day 366, if you click to them, they will be just as helpful. They are the big friendly giants of your ideaverse. \n\t- In this way, MOCs are basically just a bunch of stuff living on top of your notes. They should never get in the way of writing/creating‚Äîin fact, they should greatly *enhance* it.\n\t- See more: [[What can we learn from nerdy discussions on MOCs]]\n- **So how do I use the fluid frameworks in LYT on a daily basis?**\n\t- On a daily basis, you're just making notes, adding to notes, and not worried about having to structure things. Maybe you add a tag. Maybe a direct link to another note. That's it.\n\t- Don't worry about MOCs and the home note when you're doing basic writing and creation. You'll know when to make a new MOC because you start to feel a building sense of being overwhelmed. It happens when you have a lot of notes on a subject and need to structure the info.\n\t- The structuring is cool, but don't let the tail wag the dog :)\n- **What's the difference between an MOC and TOC? They seem interchangeable, am I missing something there?**\n\t- The distinction, which serves an important purpose, is an MOC doesn‚Äôt have to follow a linear format. It can be constantly reshuffled by you to meet your needs. It‚Äôs great for compiling topic-related ideas, notes, concepts.\n\t- Contrast that with a Table of Contents (TOC). It has one specific and linear order. A TOC should almost always find itself tied to a specific project. \n\t- So for a book project, you have the broad MOC (like a big work table with papers spread out everywhere); and you‚Äôd be building towards the specific, linear TOC, which would be the more traditional ‚Äúsection 2, chapter 1‚Äù or whatever.\n\t- On efforts and projects, I see the MOC and TOC as working in tandem more often than not.\n- **I've heard hierarchies and structures are bad.**\n\t- That can be true. But it's also not true.\n\t- Yes, a note buried deep in a series of cascading folders is harder to access. Folders act to limit a note's availability. They bury notes. This can be bad in that it reduces your potential *avenues towards note retrieval*. [^1] A note should be able to live freely and connect to as many notes as needed without restriction. \n\t- That's why MOCs (Maps of Content) are magicians: *they don't limit access; they curate it* (See [[Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea]]). MOCs exist in parallel with all your other notes. It's like having the ability to turn on an augmented overlay on top of your existing notes. They add context without constraint, freedom without friction. (Read more on MOCs at [[MOCs Overview]])\n- **How much friction will it take to manage this over time and how will it all fare if there are periods of time when I don't take the minimum amount of care to keep it updated?**\n\t- (@ryanjamurphy): There are ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù kinds of knowledge management janitorial work. Good kinds involve discovering new insights and refining your knowledge, bad kinds involve distractions and degrade your work.\n\t- (@nickmilo): I can only speak from experience, but I have gone months without looking at my digital library, many times. That's actually why I craved and created the home note and MOCs: so I could immediately reconnect with my notes. Maybe it's a philosophy, but everything should just manage itself after it's set up. I don't think of it as extra tasks.\n\n\n---\n\n## What is LYT and an Ideaverse? \n\n*Q: What is an Ideaverse?*\nIt's the universe of ideas that exists between your brain and everything around it‚Äîbut usually it refers to your digitally linked notes.\n\n*Q: Why should I care about an Ideaverse?*\nA: Do you want your notes to give you value, not just in the short-term, but forever?\nDo you lose ideas? Do you have trouble combining ideas? Are your notes scattered everywhere? Are you drowning in too much information? Have you lost the signal from the noise? If you answered yes to any of these, read on. \n\n*Q: I'm still reading...So, who benefits from having an Ideaverse?*\nA: People who write and think a lot. People who don't want to forget important ideas. People who develop ideas. People who value the ability to build upon their knowledge over years instead of letting it slip away to the ravages of time. \n\n*Q: Give me specific types of people please.*\nA: Students, academics, and life-long learners...makers, content creators, essay-writers...non-fiction and fiction writers...productivity and project-focused people...and life designers and anyone trying to live their best life. \n\n*Q: And what are ideas?* \nIdeas are solutions to problems. They are original creations or thoughts. They are new insights built on shoulders existing sources or previous work. With a dynamic ideaverse, you will finally be able to work rapidly and fluidly with ideas in ways that were previously not easy or even possible. A dynamic ideaverse holds real value for anyone who works with ideas. \n\n---\n*Q: Okay then...What is LYT?*\nA: LYT stands for \"Linking Your Thinking\". It is a proven framework for knowledge management based on using links to enhance your thinking. It articulates the theory of [[Idea Emergence (defn)]], and uses higher-order notes called \"Maps of Content\" (MOCs). See [[LYT Framework]].\n\nUse LYT to create your ideaverse. \n\n*Q: Is LYT the same thing as zettelkasten?*\nA: No. While many argue anything with linked notes written in your own words is a zettelkasten, the truth is that a zettelkasten has an extremely narrow focus: \"writing for output\". That's it. \n\nBut LYT is a framework that extends the vision, scope, and capability of a zettelkasten. It can be used for anything that requires thinking and writing. It is optimized for people to become the best sensemakers possible. And it provides new frameworks to accomplish this‚Äîespecially Maps of Content.\n\nThe LYT method enhances how you write, think, and navigate with your ideaverse. \n\n---\n*Q: Please further explain this relationship between LYT and an Ideaverse.*\nA: Basically, the LYT frameworks are what give an ideaverse it's value. It provides flexible frameworks to allow your ideaverse to thrive for the rest of your life. Using LYT frameworks adds an optional layer to enhance writing, thinking, and navigating.\n\n---\n*Q: How does LYT help with writing, thinking, and navigating?*\nA: In several synergistic ways. Because it provides comforting, reliable navigation; it lowers anxiety. Because it's flexibility, it allows for non-rigid thinking. The list of benefits is deep. See [[Benefits of LYT frameworks]] \n\n---\n*Q: Do I need LYT?*\nA: No you don't, especially when you have less than a couple hundred notes. But you may want it. You'll know if you do. It's starts with a growing sense of anxiety and overwhelm...Like a vampire thirsting for blood, you'll find yourself gravitating toward a the creation of your first MOC, so you can work with several notes at the same time. See [[Is LYT For Me]].\n\n---\n*Q: What's an MOC?*\nA: An MOC stands for \"Map of Content\". MOCs may be the most important thinking tool you can use with your zettelkasten. [[MOCs Overview]]\n\n---\n*Q: How would you describe Maps of Content?*\nA: An MOC is just a note where you collect a bunch of related notes, then you stare at it, and think. The three core purposes to use an MOC for are to: gather, develop, and navigate ideas.\n\n---\n*Q: Aren't MOCs just another name for an index note?*\nWhile an MOC can act as a static index solely for navigation, its power comes from using it to gather, develop, collide, and refactor ideas.\n\nIn this way, MOCs become an entirely new tool for thinking in The Age of the Linked Note. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/LYT-Framework":{"title":"LYT Framework","content":"up:: [[LYT Kit]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n# The LYT Framework\nLYT stands for \"Linking Your Thinking\".\n\nThe LYT framework super-charges your digital library by giving you the ability to use fluid frameworks‚Äîlike MOCs and a Home note‚Äîto enhance your ability to find things, create things, and develop ideas over time.\n\n### Why LYT?\nEquipping your library with special notes like a Home note and \"Maps of Content\" enhances your working experience.\n\nIt is robust, flexible, and able to match your changing needs‚Äîwhich are undoubtably unique to you‚Äîboth today and deep into your future.\n\n### What is the LYT Framework\nLYT provides a framework for your notes. You can find them. You can work with them. And this framework encourages them to grow more valuable over time.\n\n1. **The Home note** - The Home note can act as your home base to ground you, and as a launching pad into your note library.\n2. **Maps of Content** (MOCs) - These are like having curated worktables with all your relevant index cards placed on them. MOCs will help you overcome the overwhelming anxiety that can arise from having notes scattered everywhere. More on this later.\n3. **Other Fluid Frameworks** -  Adding structure to your notes has gotten a bad rap lately. But if you know how to keep your frameworks fluid, you'll get the best of both worlds: order *and* chaos; excellent note retrieval *and* the serendipity of discovery. More on this later. \u003c!--with fluid structures, The LYT Framework emphasizes linked frameworks.--\u003e\n---\n## The forest keeps winding...\nYou reach a particularly interesting fork in the overgrown trail.

It's even cleaner.\n-   I've incorporated nested tags. Nested tags are a big development.\n-   I'm really leaning towards taking away the numbers on my top ten MOCs (like **010 Mindsets**) because it's led some people to get really caught up thinking they have to number everything. But [what do you think?](https://www.loom.com/share/65738c3988d24f58b408e4b90282e0c9) Before I announce anything, I'm curious if you have a strong opinion on this.\n-   I took away the Calendar MOC because: I didn't use it, other people got the wrong ideas about it, and frankly, the \"Calendar\" plugin is wonderful.\n-   I shifted my Back Matter meta-data-y stuff to Front Matter; and I hid most of the Front Matter to keep control over the story being told. (Note: YAML functionality isn't quite there yet, but ask me again in a few months!)\n-   I worked in a lot more \"[Art of Link Curation](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Art+of+Link+Curation)\", where the creator responsibly guides the reader with fewer, more curated links.

In his novel **1984**, the totalitarian government enforces a language called \"Newspeak,\" which has an extremely limited vocabulary. This brutal simplification of word choice actually prevents the people from being able to articulate the complex thoughts and emotions they're having. _**It imprisons their expression.**_\n\nFast forward to the 2020's, and who would have thought we'd imprison ourselves...wearing our simple vocabularies as some sort of badge of honor(?)‚Äîand scared that using the big words will somehow screw with our identity... _...more on this soon_\n\n---\n\nüë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ\n\nThe noise üóë is deafening.

He assembled and created a unified theory of the cosmos known as **‚ÄúThe Almagest‚Äù** (which basically means ‚ÄúThe Greatest‚Äù). This text was so good, it was treated as 100% true for 1500 years!\n\nExcept, for it to have been 100% true, the Moon was supposed to double in size and then shrink back each year! But, it doesn‚Äôt. So why did really smart people believe in The Almagest? Because it could consistently tell you where the stars would be at any time of the year. (So who cares about that Moon business!)\n\nEven after Copernicus published his heliocentric theory in 1543 (casting major doubt on The Almagest), it took another century until Kepler did what no one else could: he gave up his deeply ingrained beliefs. Kepler didn‚Äôt just think outside the box, he thought _outside the circle!_ (That story is for another time.)\n\nThe Almagest is the centerpiece of a fascinating exploration‚Äînot into the stars‚Äîbut into how we form our beliefs. Here are some personal thoughts on the strangeness of what we believe:\n\n-   The Almagest shows our ability to force fit incorrect solutions, and then believe those solutions (ignoring the inconvenient parts).\n-   The Almagest shows how we conflate _some_ truth with the _whole_ truth.\n-   When reality disproves our beliefs, it‚Äôs easier to change the narrative protecting our beliefs, than to actually change our beliefs.\n-   We just believe whatever we want to believe.\n\nIt makes me wonder:\n\n-   What blind spots are we each living in right now?\n\n\n---\n\nüë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ\n\nThe noise üóë is deafening.

They are about enriching our point of view on valuable things‚Äîlong after we initially encounter them. \n\nThat's why we're adding some umami to \"Pace Layers\" üåà. \n\nSince I mentioned Pace Layers [two weeks ago](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Spaces/LYT+Notes/LYT+Notes+1), your insights have enriched the concept for me. Here are two that I've really enjoyed:\n\n### Hojae L. on Pace Layers and LYT frameworks\n(slightly edited from Discord)\n\n- The article from Nick's Feb, 21st newsletter talks about pace layers in context of civilization/culture. \n- The original idea by Frank Duffy apparently thought of it in terms of architecture and buildings.\n- Each layer of the Pace Layers have different \"speeds\".\n- This stood out to me from the article: \"Each layer is functionally different from the others and operates somewhat independently, but each layer influences and responds to the layers closest to it in a way that makes the whole system resilient.\"\n- One is not better than the other (In fact I think it's about how you need different layers for civilization to be healthy....)\n\nIn terms of LYT I can see how a Home note or higher-level MOCs can be considered \"slow\" layers - they take time to develop, \"integrate shock\".\n\nAtomic notes can be \"Fast\" layers. The name \"atomic\" already gives a hint of discreteness or discontinuity.\n\n---\nI'm so glad **Hojae** related Pace Layers to the LYT frameworks! For those of you who don't know, the LYT frameworks are based around the idea of \"Idea Emergence\":\n\n\u003e Idea Emergence is the process of how you the ideas you encounter go from the \"nothingness\" to the \"somethingness\"‚Äîand how those ideas grow in richness and complexity over time.\n\nIn this way, I have found Pace Layers to be a good fit to what's happening in the LYT frameworks‚Äîexcept in reverse! \n\n- You're linking a bunch of small notes together. This is basically the fast-moving chaos of a zettelkasten...\n- ...which leads to you assemble several links into a higher-order note that we'll call a \"Map of Content\" (MOC). \n\t- This is an emergent structure (i.e. direct links leading to MOCs)\n- ...which over time lead to more mature, more convergent structures (like a Home dashboard-y note). \n- But even as the Home note is being shaped from the faster moving layers, it can't help but to subtly shape the faster moving MOCs it links to.\n\nAnd that's how Idea Emergence beautifully exhibits the dynamics of Pace Layers!\n\n---\nAnd to add to the depth of our understanding about Pace Layers, Mike B, relates it to Time.\n\n---\n\n### Mike B. on Pace Layers and the \"Long Now\"\n(slightly edited from Discord)\n\n*The link to Pace Layers in @NickMilo's newsletter mentioned \"The Long Now\". I wondered how Pace Layers related to this concept, and I found this from Brian Eno:*\n\n\u003e \"Now\" is never just a moment. The Long Now is the recognition that the precise moment you're in grows out of the past and is a seed for the future. The longer your sense of Now, the more past and future it includes. ‚Äì [Essay: The Big Here and Long Now - Brian Eno](https://longnow.org/essays/big-here-long-now/ \"https://longnow.org/essays/big-here-long-now/\")\n\n-*The quote resonates with me about making notes and building a knowledge management system as much as it does about having a \"Long Now\" view of life, the universe, and everything.* \n\n- *\"Note making\" has long had the idea of future-proofing and making notes for your future self. \n- Instilling a \"longer sense of Now\" into our notes and system, I think, is the key to making our notes resilient. \n- And I believe it is a broader and better expression of how we should approach making notes, and I find it a little more poetic than future-proofing.*\n\n*I also think there is something to pace layering regarding our time and interactions with our note-making. *\n\n---\nI'm so happy Mike shared these insights around Time. Thanks Mike!\n\nThis makes me wonder: \n- How can I try to incorporate the \"longer sense of now\" into the conversation for future-proofing?\n- How well does a clock represent the dynamics of Pace Layers and the \"Long Now\", with the different paces of the second hand, the minute hand, and the hour hand?\n\nMy mind needs time to chew on this...\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/LYT-Notes-4-Example":{"title":"LYT Notes 4 (Example)","content":"up:: [[My Newsletter MOC]]\ntags:: #output/newsletter \ndates:: 2021-03-14\n\n## On a \"hiding in plain sight\" advantage to using folders \nLinks are revolutionary. And yet, there is still a place for folders and tags in a healthy knowledge management system (don't let the zealots tell you otherwise).\n\nHere's one hidden advantage to using folders in a link-based world: *easy exclusion*.\n\nExample: You have a folder with private medical and financial information called \"Private\". You want to search for \"health\" and don't want to see noisy results from your daily notes and other random notes. So in either the file searches or the graph searches you can just type `health path:Private`. And boom! You'll receive noise-free results :)\n\nImagine that, folders being used to *flexibly* silo information from each other!\n\nHere are the three notations to keep handy when using folder search filters:\n\n`path:folder`\n`path:\"folder with multiple words\"`\n`-path:folder` - With the minus sign you can exclude folders from search. If you save too many words from other people, you might want to get comfortable with `your_search -path:Sources` , or something like that.\n\n(There is a similar ability with **Anti-Tags** I'll try to talk about next week.)\n\n\n## On refactoring: the mini-epiphany of evergreen note-making\nWhen we exercise the bad habit of excessive note-*taking*, we rarely return to the thing we took notes on, because we're off bumbling down the never-ending trail of over-consumption. And we even more rarely ever build it, develop it, and refactor it. \n\nSo how is note-*making* better? You not only spend more time actively thinking, but you create an environment that encourages you to continue to develop those thoughts. Here's a simple example I can share with you. Try reading both of these out loud:\n\n\u003e George Orwell understood the power of language. In his novel **1984**, the totalitarian government enforces a language called \"Newspeak,\" which has an extremely limited vocabulary. This brutal simplification of word choice actually prevents the people from being able to articulate the complex thoughts and emotions they're having. It imprisons their expression.\n\nThat was from the \"LYT Notes 1\" newsletter. Not bad, but two weeks later, as I was thinking about how to introduce the wonders and joy of the Thesaurus in a video, I actually rewrote that into something clearer, more impactful...better:\n\n\u003e George Orwell understood the power of language. In his novel **1984**, the Big Brother government enforces a language called \"NewSpeak\" that eliminates words. They get rid of \"bad\". They get rid of \"great\". Now there's just \"ungood\" and \"double-plus good\". This brutal collapse of word choice imprisons our ability to express ourselves...our ability to articulate the complex thoughts and emotions we're having.\n\nCan you see how this note is growing with me? And how it's growing in value and complexity over time? That's a mini-epiphany, isn't it?! That's the power of evergreen note-making. \n\nSo, how do you save the old version? How do you work with the new version? Here's [the full note](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Sources/1949+%F0%9F%93%9A+1984) where you can get a glimpse into this process of both \"versioning\" \u0026 \"refactoring\". \n\n## On Cohort 3 finishing the LYT Workshop\nWe had 7 main sessions, 7 breakout sessions, 5 special sessions, and 2 additional sessions for extra capstone presentations‚Äîall leading to over 30 hours of LIVE time together!\n\nAs much as I'm proud of the curriculum, it's the assembly of fascinating and friendly people that is fast becoming an equally powerful draw. Just yesterday, we had our final three capstone presentations from a director in Slovenia, a Buddhist monk in Australia, and an experienced business consultant in \"regenerative management\" in the US. (They are other things as well, I don't mean to typecast!)\n\nI love these workshops and remain hugely grateful for their existence. But that said, the next LIVE workshop won't be until later this summer.\n\n## On the upcoming Guided Self-Study\nBut there is a solution for those of you who don't want to wait. The 6-week Guided Self-Study program starts on April 6th. Along with the curriculum and access to the LYT community, there will also be 3+ live hours (the orientation plus a couple coach-led sessions).\n\nRegistration will open next week on March 21st. I'll share the details then.\n\n\nAs always, Stay Connected!\n\nNick\n\nPS: I'm creating a *\"Choose Your Own Adventure\" Obsidian Training Experience*. It'll cost basically nothing and have random, ongoing updates. It should cost WAY more but I don't care.

Down 17 points with under 6 minutes remaining, Damian Lillard led his team to an improbable comeback win, scoring 20 points in the final quarter (and 50 points for the entire game).\n\nBut it was the post-game interview that I found the most notable:\n\n**Shaq**: *To all the little kids out there, how do you become a lethal shooter?*\n\n**Damian**: *I think it's just putting a lot of time into it...that it's a lot of **reps**...whether people are watching or whether you get credit for it or not, you just, you put the time in, and you do it at a game pace, you do it with focus, you do it...at the end of your workout when you're tired (and you probably don't want to do it): just things like that, over and over and over and over. Over the years.*\n\n*You get better from the **reps**, but I think more so than just physically, you get better mentally and more confident in it because you've done it so often you don't when you tired, you've done it when you didn't want to.*\n\n*And then in the moments, you know end of the game, whether it's first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, a tough shot, the easy shot, you you got the ultimate confidence that is gonna go in and I think confidence is the biggest thing for shooters right next to just getting the **reps** in.*\n\n---\nLet's re-strengthen and rebuild our thinking muscles. The good news is: just like our physical muscles, we can make big changes in relatively short amounts of time. We just have to get the reps.\n\n- How do you get the reps?\n- How can you get better reps?\n\nThis is one of the most essential concepts to live by in my opinion. Here's the note I have on [reps in the LYT Kit](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Reps). (Notice how it's already exhibiting evergreen-ness by already connecting to Damian?)\n\n## On the Anti-Tag\nThe anti-tag sounds like some sort of super-villain, but it‚Äôs actually just another trick employed by a wily PKM‚Äôer.\n\nLet‚Äôs say I use a daily note but after tons and tons of daily notes, my graph is useless. One solution is to have all your daily notes in a folder, like ‚ÄúTimestamps‚Äù and filter out that entire folder with the notation: `-path:Timestamps` (like I emailed about last week).\n\nYou can also do this with an anti-tag. Imagine every daily note of yours has the tag \"#my/daily. You can filter out all of our daily notes from a search by adding the notation:\n\n- `-tag:my/daily`\n\nBut depending on your needs, you may develop the desire to slice your notes with an even fineer razor. Consider the following notation:\n\n- `#my/daily -my/journal`\n\nUsing this search string, I can look at all my daily entries except ones with personal information that have also been tagged with the journal tag.\n\nI'm not suggesting you do this, but it's worth knowing how you can use tags to NOT find something.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/LYT-Space-kit":{"title":"LYT Space (kit)","content":"up:: [[Home]]\ntags:: #map\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]+ Notes on this note\n\u003e This is a sanitized version of my actual note. \n\u003e - Content and links have been removed.\n\u003e - Nick, go here [[LYT Home]].\n\n# LYT Space üîÜ (kit)\nWhen you add links to folder-based PKM, you need MOCs.

These leaps of insight are not only fun, but they are all potential sources of new value creation (along with making you more interesting to interact with).\n\nA hidden benefit of deliberately linking your thinking is that [[Note-making creates unexpected optionality]].","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/MOCs-Overview":{"title":"MOCs Overview","content":"up:: [[LYT Kit]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n# MOCs Overview\nThis is a brief overview of MOCs. \n\n- MOC stands for **Maps of Content** because these notes *map* the contents of some of your notes.\n- MOC is pronounced `EM-OH-CEE`.\n- MOCs help you gather, develop, and navigate ideas.\n\n## When to use MOCs\nThe ability to know when and how to make an MOC is a key skill in overcoming overwhelm and project slowdown.\n\nWhenever you start to feel that tickle of overwhelm ([[Mental Squeeze Point]]), that's when you need to *become a cartographer of your own content* and create a new MOC. \n\nFor example, let's say you have 20 scattered notes on the project you‚Äôre making. Just like putting 20 index cards on an inviting rustic workbench, putting links to all 20 notes into a new MOCs is the digital equivalent.\n\nWhat is a mental squeeze point? \n\n![[Mental Squeeze Point#^64cf60a6]]\n\n(That's from a bottom-up starting point. You will also want to use MOCs to make sense out of existing knowledge from a top-down starting point.)\n\n## Why use MOCs\n1. MOCs help you **manage anxiety** in a positive way by allowing you a dedicated space to place related notes together.\n2. In that space, MOCs create a concentrated environment that **encourages rapid ideation** through the interaction, exchange, and development of thoughts, notions, and ideas.\n3. After you've developed an MOC you're happy with, it **becomes a reference** for whatever project you need to complete: an essay, a product, a summation of thought on a topic. Thanks to developing your MOC, you might find that your new project is already 80% complete.\n4. The MOC remains as a **reliable navigational tool** to the rest of your digital library.\n5. The MOC also **acts as a reminding tool** on a subject. Years later you can quickly return to it and remember, \"Oh I remember now, that's what I thought about the how the evolution of fonts related to the broader movements of Art History!\"\n6. The MOC **remains ready to evolve** as your thoughts grow, mature, develop complexity on a subject. \n7. MOCs **maintain their fluidity**: As opposed to folders, MOCs are nondestructive, non-restrictive, non-limiting perspectives. Unlike a folder, you are not forced to use them to access your notes. MOCs are ‚Äúoverlays‚Äù that add relevant information but that don't affect your base level notes. \n8. MOCs **allow for limitless flexibility**. Unlike folders or Table of Contents (TOC), MOCs are not hierarchical. They are [[Heterarchy|heterarchical]]. This means that different MOCs can map the same info in different ways, to fit whatever your current needs might be.\n9. MOCs **encourage \"Relational Positioning\"**: Don't argue with the Ancient Greeks and Romans about the [[Method of Loci|value of spatial relationships]]. It helps us remember better when ideas are not floating in isolation, but as a part of a spatial constellation.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/MOCs-are-Dialectics":{"title":"MOCs are Dialectics","content":"up:: [[LYT Kit]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n\u003e [!NOTE]+ Notes on this note\n\u003e This is a sanitized version of my actual note. \n\u003e - Some content and links have been removed.\n\n# MOCs are Dialectics\nIdeas are often forged in argument where opposing propositions are set against each other. \n\nThis is what happens when notes are placed in a room together and forced to figure things out. \n\nIdeas bump and jostle.

Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time, received more attention than her writing. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences.\n\u003e\n\u003e During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children's book. Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.\n\u003e\n\u003e After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower published a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.\n\u003e\n\u003e After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died 11 days after giving birth to her second daughter, [[Mary Shelley]], who would become an accomplished writer and author of Frankenstein.\n\u003e\n\u003e [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%20Wollstonecraft)","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Mental-Squeeze-Point":{"title":"Mental Squeeze Point","content":"up:: [[LYT Kit]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n# Mental Squeeze Point\nA **Mental Squeeze Point** is when your unsorted knowledge becomes so messy it overwhelms and discourages you.

So many fascinating angles. \n\n[[Natural Selection]] is closely related to [[Hormesis]] and [[Antifragility]].\n\n\n\n## Wiki\nNatural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations\n\n### Wiki: Mechanism: Heritable variation, differential reproduction\n*Natural variation occurs among the individuals of any population of organisms. Some differences may improve an individual's chances of surviving and reproducing such that its lifetime reproductive rate is increased, which means that it leaves more offspring.* If the traits that give these individuals a reproductive advantage are also `heritable`, that is, passed from parent to offspring, then there will be differential reproduction, that is, a slightly higher proportion of fast rabbits or efficient algae in the next generation. *Even if the reproductive advantage is very slight, over many generations any advantageous heritable trait becomes dominant in the population.* \n\n*In this way the natural environment of an organism \"selects for\" traits that confer a reproductive advantage, causing evolutionary change, as Darwin described.[57] This gives the appearance of purpose, but in natural selection there is no intentional choice.*\n\n### Wiki: Mechanism: Fitness\nThe concept of fitness is central to natural selection. In broad terms, individuals that are more \"fit\" have better potential for survival, as in the well-known phrase \"survival of the fittest\", but the precise meaning of the term is much more subtle. *Modern evolutionary theory defines fitness not by how long an organism lives, but by how successful it is at reproducing.* If an organism lives half as long as others of its species, but has twice as many offspring surviving to adulthood, its genes become more common in the adult population of the next generation. Though natural selection acts on individuals, the effects of chance mean that fitness can only really be defined \"on average\" for the individuals within a population. The fitness of a particular genotype corresponds to the average effect on all individuals with that genotype.[61] A distinction must be made between the concept of \"survival of the fittest\" and \"improvement in fitness\". *\"Survival of the fittest\" does not give an \"improvement in fitness\", it only represents the removal of the less fit variants from a population. *\n\n### Wiki: Mechanism: Competition\n*In biology, competition is an interaction between organisms in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another.

Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases. The widespread misuse of antibiotics has selected for microbial resistance to antibiotics in clinical use, to the point that the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been described as a \"superbug\" because of the threat it poses to health and its relative invulnerability to existing drugs.[87] Response strategies typically include the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new strains of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs.[88] *This is an evolutionary arms race, in which bacteria develop strains less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers attempt to develop new antibiotics that can kill them.\n*\n### Wiki: Impact: Universal Darwinism\nDarwin's ideas, along with those of Adam Smith and Karl Marx, had a profound influence on 19th century thought, including his radical claim that \"elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner\" evolved from the simplest forms of life by a few simple principles.[113] This inspired some of Darwin's most ardent supporters‚Äîand provoked the strongest opposition. Natural selection had the power, according to Stephen Jay Gould, to \"dethrone some of the deepest and most traditional comforts of Western thought\", such as the belief that humans have a special place in the world.[114]\n\nIn the words of the philosopher Daniel Dennett, *Darwin's dangerous idea\" of evolution by natural selection is a \"universal acid,\" which cannot be kept restricted to any vessel or container, as it soon leaks out, working its way into ever-wider surroundings.[115] Thus, in the last decades, the concept of natural selection has spread from evolutionary biology to other disciplines, including evolutionary computation, quantum Darwinism, evolutionary economics, evolutionary epistemology, evolutionary psychology, and cosmological natural selection. This unlimited applicability has been called universal Darwinism.*","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Newtons-Laws-of-Motion":{"title":"Newton's Laws of Motion","content":"up:: [[Art \u0026 Science Storytelling MOC]], [[Habits MOC - Collide]]\ntags:: #concept\ndates:: ‚âà1642 - 1726\npeople:: [[Isaac Newton]]\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]+ Notes on this note\n\u003e This is a sanitized version of my actual note. \n\u003e - Some content and links have been removed.\n\n# Newton's Laws of Motion\nIn classical mechanics, Newton's laws of motion are three laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it.

With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well received audition, which she attributed to racism. In 2003, just days before her death, the Institute awarded her an honorary degree.To make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to \"Nina Simone\" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play \"the devil's music\" or so-called \"cocktail piano\". She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with Little Girl Blue. She had a hit single in the United States in 1958 with \"I Loves You, Porgy\". Her musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.\n\u003e\n\u003e [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina%20Simone)","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/No-Face":{"title":"No-Face","content":"up:: [[Concepts MOC]]\ntags:: #concept\n\n# No-Face\n*The self-destructive primal tension everybody harbors.*  \n\nNo-Face is a spirit in the 2001 Japanese animated film Spirited Away.

In the optometry office, they call this device a Phoropter. For the purposes of thinking, we'll call this technique spending time in \"Refraction-based thinking\".\n\n\"Refraction\" has a different goal than \"action\". Refraction is for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Action is about getting things done. Both are essential. Too much refraction and you fall into Hamlet's trap, who even though he knew his uncle murdered his father, procrastinated from decisive action because of \"paralysis by analysis\".\n\nApplying \"refraction\" to our thinking is similar to applying a \"mental model\", but they tend to stand apart because of the purpose. While Refraction is primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding, the use of \"Mental Models\" is primarily for pattern recognition for efficient, optimal action. The answer here is quite simply to find a balance.

How does one improve their triangulation skills?\n\nExactly!!! By getting reps connecting ideas. One of the best ways is using MOCs to cluster ideas, which will spark connections and spur insights.\n\nErick Wutke 1 day ago\nWhen you put yourself (Nick), as a \"mediator\" for the concept apprehension, I thought: \"wow, this isn't just concept triangulation, it's more: he's got his Ren√© Girard on point\"\n\nME: Thank you! Can you elaborate on the Ren√© Girard reference? I would love to know how he did things\n\nThat is quite a task I'll try. Basically Girard \"discovered\" another facet of the human nature: that every desire is mimetic, or as the early version of the theory says: that there's a \"mimetic triangulation of desire\" where the mediator, who possesses the object of desire (with time) is to be hated/envied if he is close to the person who desires (like a friend, parent, etc), or admired if he is far (just like I admire Girard because I want \"his\" intelligence, theoretic capacity, etc). \n\nHe started observing this in literature, stating that there is a \"Romantic Lie\" in which the objects are desired for themselves, and a \"Novelistic Truth\" in which the triangulation is unveiled (Dostoievsky, Shakespeare, Cervantes, Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust... Our Machado de Assis) and then in Anthropology, in the Bible and mythic narratives, always revealing a layer of envy or pursuit depending on the distance of a mediator from the person who desires.\n\nThe theory gets more interesting when the object desired and the mediator are the same person, which is what makes us prone into thinking that love, for example, is a linear thing (the Romantic Lie). But the triangular dynamic is still kept the same: you can strive to achieve the very same thing that you develop resentment towards to in the process. Or in the case of Narcissus, where he himself occupies the three points of the triangle! \n\nThe theory also adds some interesting layers to the Freudian \"Totem and Taboo\" archetype of the origin of societal violence and subsequent legislation and mitigation of violence, too. There's a temptation to try and explain every event of escape-goating and society violence as the multiplication of interconnected close triangules that scales up. \n\nBut some commentators note that could not explain the genocides of the 20th century as it can explain the escape-goating of Jesus and other figures in much smaller scale. So... going back to the video, you're definitely not wrong in noting that for us to apprehend something, to \"take hold of it\", we need to get it through someone who already \"owns\" it, and to bring one closer, is to bring the other too - to a point =P\n\nME: Whoa. You are correct about the size of the task I was requesting, but I'm grateful you've enlightened me on this angle of the topic!\n\n# Tweet thread\nHere's the link to the finished version on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1562063375491817473](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1562063375491817473).\n\nPeople complain about Obsidian graphs, but they're forgetting its most powerful purpose... TRIANGULATION! Here's how you can use it to unlock new insights in your PKM üëá\n\n\nWhat is \"triangulation?\" Triangulation is how we make sense of the world. We do it all the time! It's using two \"known points\" to find a third \"unknown point.\" Triangulation helps you: 1. UNDERSTAND 2. REMEMBER 3. \u0026 IMAGINE Now let me show you how they work...\n\n\nThe 1st Power of Triangulation: UNDERSTAND üìê \nUse what you know to understand what you don't! For example, here are 3 (very simple) points: ‚Ä¢ you (known) ‚Ä¢ me (known) ‚Ä¢ idea (unknown) Your goal: Understand this idea ‚Üí \"Pace Layers\"\n\n\nIf you don't know me... or the idea... you can't make a nice triangle. So you won't understand! If you know me better... you can use me as an anchor point to better understand Pace Layers. When you are clear on two points, you can better understand the third point.\n\n\nWe do this countless times a day! We triangulate to understand how things we *know* relate to things we *don't know.* Once you have a bunch of dots on your Map, you can UNDERSTAND things rapidly. But how do you REMEMBER all the dots?\n\n\nThe 2nd Power of Triangulation: REMEMBER üìê\nUse what you know to remember what you forgot! For example, let's say, you can't remember \"Pace Layers\". But you might remember the originator \"Steward Brand\" ([@stewartbrand](https://twitter.com/stewartbrand)). And from there, you'll remember \"Pace Layers.\"\n\n\nTriangulating to remember is how our brains naturally work. Try it out with your graph. Hover over one idea. What is it connected to? Over time, your ideas will have many links. And this is how we build powerful and personal Knowledge Networks.\n\n\nWhen you know two points, you can better remember a third point. Once you have a bunch of dots on your Map, you can REMEMBER things rapidly. But how do you create with the stuff you know?\n\n\nThe 3rd Power of Triangulation: IMAGINE üìê\nUse what you know to imagine new insights! This is the radical power of linking your thinking. By building your connective thinking muscle you become a creative machine.\n\n\nNow at the random crossroads between ideas, you are generating INSIGHTS! That means new forms of value. You are imagining worlds, products, and services. When you know two points, you can better imagine the third point.\n\n\nThese are the 3 triangulation powers to help think better than ever before! 1. Use what you know to make sense of stuff 2. Use what you know to remember old stuff 3. Use what you know to create new stuff The better you triangulate, the faster you can move in the world of ideas!\n\n\nFor more graphics, insights, and commentary on the 3 powers of triangulation, check out this 6-minute video: [youtu.be/JV_7nppxv7A](https://t.co/giVpsK9Ku1)\n\n\nBy the way, some of these graphics came from one of [@ProfFeynman](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman)'s more hidden lectures called \"Tips on Physics\": [https://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/TIPS_01.html](https://t.co/eC0MDjvZWW)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Newsletter copy\n## Sensemaking happens by Triangulation\n\n‚ÄúTriangulation‚Äù is using two known points to find a third point. Triangulating is how we make sense of the world.\n\nTriangulation is why we love to link our thoughts.\n\nIt‚Äôs how we do our best thinking!\n\nThe better you triangulate, the faster you can move in the world of ideas.\n\nWe might as we see how it works, right?\n\nHere‚Äôs my video on Triangulation:\n\n[![](https://functions-js.convertkit.com/playbutton?play=%23FFFFFF\u0026accent=%235dbcd2\u0026thumbnailof=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJV_7nppxv7A\u0026width=480\u0026height=270\u0026fit=contain)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV_7nppxv7A)\n\nHint: The last power is what **Idea Emergence** looks like.\n\nI posted [a Twitter thread about triangulation](https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1550144971948232709?s=20\u0026t=Qb1ekZ-OqUAK2FkmfQoBOw) too.

Definitely. But if you're reading it because you think you don't already know how to set goals, then you might just be procrastinating. That's because there is a truth we don't honor in an aggressively productive society. Let's say it in different ways:\n\n\u003eYou already know what you need to know. You just need to do it.\n\n%%\n\n---\n\n- We approach what we don't know through the lens of what we do know. \n- We approach the unknown through the lens of the known. \n\n---\n\n### Example Alt Long\nWhether it's a forum post, youtube video, or Amazon review, why do we feel compelled to read the comments? Why is watching gamers comment about their gaming a multi-billion dollar industry?

It keeps the entire system organized.\n\n\n1. Go to the [[Home]] note. Check it out. \n\t- Review the MOCs in your Home note.\n      - Do you see categories that relate to you?\n    - Review the keywords below\n2. Now start clicking all the links.

That's powerful.\n\t- Do you see any patterns with how some of the Home MOCs are structured? Any you could imagine using?\n4. What MOC is a subject you already have notes on? \n\t- Start linking your own notes to that existing MOC. \n5. Customize that MOC to your heart's content.\n\nThat's the basic process.\n\nRemember, the structure works *for you*, not the other way around (See [[Is LYT For Me]]). You can always just create thousands of notes without looking at the home note once. \n\n---\n### Advanced steps\n1. In the [[Home]] note, start customizing the Home MOCs to suit your personal needs. Less is more at the start of your journey. A bulleted list can be faster to work in (and easier to maintain) than a complicated table.\n2. Play around, break things. Some categories you thought would work won't. That's fine, just rejigger things until they work better for you.\n\nFor more guidance on this, go to: [[Figuring out your Home MOCs]]","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.064978726Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Shadow-Clone":{"title":"Shadow Clone","content":"up:: [[Concepts MOC]]\ntags:: #concept \n\n# Shadow Clone\n_Divide your energies to accomplish more, at the cost of increasing your fragility, exposure, and vulnerability_\n\n_Like multi-tasking_\n\nTo create one or more copies of themselves.

So with that disclaimer out of the way, if you do the things that easily get you into flow‚Äîand ideally create some sort of additional value (extra money, quality time with others)‚Äîthen it's likely not a destructive type of flow (like playing online games too much).

(Main Elements: [[Direction (re Flow)]], [[Enthusiasm (re Flow)]])\n    - **Make a game out of it** ‚Äî So you really don't see any strong connection between your activity and your goals, so you just can't seem to summon the enthusiasm for it. So try making a game out of it. How fast can you get the task done with complete focus and zero distractions?

I hope to share in a slow-burning series of love letters to the thinkers and doers that danced before me in the ongoing tapestry of thoughts and actions that help color our human story.\n\nI see an OVERLAY WINDOW listing out what I'm saying. Title in the upper left: Why the 5 Decade Rule works. Subtitle: Old Enough. Bullet: Your Idea Grandparent's greatest contributions have already been made and vetted as long as you've been alive. Subtitle2: Young Enough. Bullet: You still share enough of the same historical context with your Idea Grandparents to easily understand their ideas.\n\n## Progeny of this concept\nI point to my PKM system for surfacing this [[happy little accident]]. \n\nIt was an epiphany that hit me as I made a special view to show relevant people of prominence in my PKM system\n\n\n# Efforts\n## Youtube script\n\n### Hook\nFind your favorite thinkers and doers born five decades before you. \n\nThey are your grandparents‚Äînot of blood, but of ideas. \n\nAnd they can help you, more than others.\n\nIn the following, I'll share: how I discovered this, why it works, and how you can use it (plus a surprising takeaway at the end).\n\nLet's roll.\n\n### CTA: Sub\nBut first, it's crazy that over 77% of you are not subscribed. That's what I get for not asking. If you've been watching, and you're enjoying, please subscribe, because it helps me make more videos for you. Cool? Okay, let's go.\n\n### Intro\nIf you only organize alphabetically, you are missing out. To really understand something, every piece of context can really help. We already do this with our notes with things like \"Date Created\", but what about with people. Wouldn't be kinda cool to organize by date born?\n\nActually it is. It tells you so much it's ridiculous we don't do it more often. So let's do some People Mapping now, and see how that led to the 5 Decade Rule...\n\n### P1: Discovering the 5 Decade Rule through People Mapping\n%%walkthrough of Obsidian and Prominent People, the hardest part%%\nSo I was note-making one day and decided to do this for people...\n\n\nI point to my PKM system for surfacing this [[happy little accident]]. \n\nIt was an epiphany that hit me as I made a special view to show relevant people of prominence in my PKM system. \n\nWhen you have your own linked world of ideas, you will find these epiphanies happening consistently.\n\n### P2: Why the 5 Decade Rule works\nWhat do [[Carl Sagan (kit)]] and [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (kit)]] have in common? They were born the same year. And that year\n\n- They are old enough to have already made their greatest contributions.\n\t- And those contributions have been vetted as long as you've been alive.  \n- They are young enough to come from the same cultural understandings.\n\t- Meaning, you are able to see how they lived their life in a cultural context at least somewhat similar to your own.\n\n### P3: How to use the 5 Decade Rule\nTake a moment, right now, and think about the big idea influencers in your life. Make a quick list. 5 people. Maybe more. But at least five. \n\nNow, go online and find out what year they were born. \n\nLet me say this clearly: It is a big, BIG problem if everyone you learn from is in their 20's. The best and most enriching way to learn is to learn from people from all ages‚Äîfrom every decade‚Äîand the majority of people you learn from should already be dead.\n\nSo now, after you've grabbed their birth year, any patterns emerging?\n\nLet's go deeper. After doing this exercise, take a moment to recognize the extra questions you started asking yourself. This is where the magic happens that's so hard to pin down. But let's put a spotlight on it. For Carl Sagan and Mihaly, I want to know where they were during World War II. They were both kids then. How did that impact their psyche? Who else did I resonate with that was born in a similar period of time?\n\nThis is what you get, when you give yourself a gift of a well-linked thinking environment.\n\nIn this process, I hope you come to realize how much you may have missed out on organizing books, movies, and even people‚Äîby birth date.\n\n\n### Conclusion: A surprising takeaway\nAs I was thinking about all of this, it struck me: a worthwhile goal. \n\n- It makes me think of a peculiar goal: *to be what they are to me.* \n\t- To have someone (not in my family) 5 decades younger than me, deeply express how my thoughts have changed their life...*to be what they are to me.* \n\t- I guess I will be on the lookout in the late 2060's...\n\n### Outro\nHey, I hope you enjoyed the 5 Decade Rule. It's a nice concept handle. Please, please, please share your Idea Grandparents in the comments below. Let's get inspired by each other.\n\nAnd until next time my friends, Stay Connected!\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.068978917Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/The-Home-note-vs-The-MOC-Library":{"title":"The Home note vs The MOC Library","content":"up:: [[Home]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n\u003e [!NOTE]+ Notes on this note\n\u003e This is a sanitized version of my actual note. \n\u003e - Some content and links have been removed.\n\n# The [[Home]] note vs [[Library]]\nThe [[Home|Home]] note is like the [[1942 - Foundation Series (1942-93)|First Foundation]], while the [[Library]] note is like the Second Foundation. \n\n- The first foundation is about ingenuity and free will. \n- The second foundation is about structuring chaos acceptably.

So with the riddle solved we were able to open presents.\n\nYou'd think I would have been happy to open presents; but I wasn't. I was disappointed because I was robbed of a wonderful riddle. \n\nMy dad wouldn't live much longer, so moments like these weighed heavy on me. I wanted the riddle to live on, so two weeks later I was back in the college dorms, writing the whole thing out on the wall of the bathroom stall. (And pleading with them not to go online to find the answer.)\n\nEveryone soon found out about the riddle and word reached them that I wrote it. Then something amazing happened. For weeks, the whole floor in the dormitory would stop me and ask if they had the right answer. They didn't fast-forward, the didn't cheat the riddle‚Äîand it was a lot of fun.\n\nBecause that's the thing about life that we keep forgetting. We are addicted to the answer.

It's the immediate expression of the law of [[Cause and Effect]]\n\nChange your mind to change your brain to change your mind. Reminds of a tautological [[Feedback Loop]].\n\nJust like Newton's Law of Conservation states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; so with habits are that for every action, taking the same action again will require less effort. Neural connections were made and repeated actions optimize them. They become more efficient. \n\n**\"Neurons that fire together wire together‚Äù** - Hebb's Rule\n\n**\"Passing mental states become lasting neural traits‚Äù** - maybe Rick Hanson\n\nWe can only surmise as to why, but to me it has clear evolutionary advantages. Any action we take burns calories and uses either our physical muscles, our mental muscles (like the anterior cingulate cortex, which is a crucial player in willpower management), or both. By making a repeated action easier, less energy is used, less willpower is required, and fewer calories are burned‚Äîall of which lead to a better chance of survival. \n\nSee also: [[The truest habit metaphors are additive - v1]]","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.068978917Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/The-truest-habit-metaphors-are-additive":{"title":"The truest habit metaphors are additive","content":"up:: [[Habits MOC]]\ntags:: #on/habit, #on/mind \n\n# The truest habit metaphors are additive\nThere are two metaphorical ways to talk about habits: additive and subtractive.\n\n**Subtractive**\nWhen you repeat the same action, it's like walking the same path: eventually a trail forms.

Let's cultivate this inherently rich endeavor.\n\nMy first stop for thinking is to the [[Notebox]] where I do what's easy. That means bouncing from note to note, developing them in a special way to maintain [[Flow]]. I keep the [[Concepts MOC]] handy because I believe a handful of core concepts influence our entire worldview in disproportionately powerful ways. These notes help me make leaps of insights while connecting new ideas to existing concepts.\n\nI'm a big believing in the power of prompts. A couple good prompts is enough to kickstart my thinking. That's why I have so many notes on prompts such as \"The NoMa Method\", the \"7 C's\", and even the \"11 C's\". But for the LYT Kit, I'll just point you towards [[Refraction Thinking]] and [[Levels of Magnification]]. \n\nIf you want to solve a problem *and* gain clarity, a nice concept to brush up on is the [[OODA Loop]].\n\nOutside the scope of the LYT Kit are my joyful suite of mind exercises. I love jumping into the gauntlet of [[Thought Unpacking]] and [[Thought Enriching]]‚Äîboth of which generate large quantities of [[Thought Collisions]]. The \"unpacking\" is best to prompt critical and analytical thinking. The \"enriching\" is best to exercise the lateral, creative, and metaphorical muscles of the mind.\n\nWant more mind training? \n\n- Go to [[Meditation Jaunts]] and [[Brief Meditation Sequences]] to slow down and reset.\n- Go to a few of your [[Mind Palaces]] to work your visualizing muscles.\n- Combine the mental with the physical for the world-champion [[Lucia Stance]]\n- A few grounding tactics are to brush up the [[FlowCreation MOC]] and [[Habits MOC]]s.\n\nAlways remember, one of the best prompting tools out there is the thesaurus. So when you want to both jumpstart and enrich your thinking, grab a thesaurus and go on a [[Word Excursion]].\n\n## Definitions\nLet's define some overlapping conceptual categories:\n\n-   **Concept**: A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.\n-   **Mental Models** are specific readily-available patterns or mechanisms that‚Äî*when applied to a current situation or thing*‚Äîallow for efficient, optimal action. Great for strategic agency and in-the-moment adaptability.\n-   **Metaphors** are primarily for relating unlike things. Great for creative expression and a means unto itself.\n-   [[Refraction Thinking]] is primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Great for reviewing, planning, empathizing, and meditating. \n\n## Three thinking styles\n1. Top-down thinking\n2. [[Bottom-up thinking]]\n3.

Later, James Clear argued for a fourth step \"craving\", which I always felt was missing as well. Here's the cycle as I see it:\n\n- **Cue** (Make it Obvious vs Invisible)\n- **Craving** (Make it Attractive vs Unattractive) - timing is important\n- **Routine** (Make it Easy vs Difficult)\n- **Reward** (Make it Satisfying vs Unsatisfying) - Behaviors that are immediately rewarded get repeated. Behaviors that are immediately punished don't get repeated. That's why you need to make it enjoyable in the moment. One way is tying your identity to it. Frame your rewards.\n\nFor more, see [[How Atomic Habits fit into the conversation on habits]].\n\nDuhigg calls the most important habits \"Keystone Habits\". These are the special habits, that by doing, make all the other habits that much easier to accomplish.

Every note in a note library is a note. They come in two basic varieties: \n\n1. A [[What is a note|note]] with mostly words\n2. A note with mostly links to other notes\n\nLet's agree for the moment that a \"note-with-mostly-words\" is less complex than a \"note-with-mostly-links\". \n\nA note with mostly links can therefore be considered a **higher-order note**. It is still a note, but all those links help to provide some sort of structure that adds complexity to the note itself. \n\nLet's explore the wonderful world of higher-order notes.\n\n### What can we call higher-order notes?\nAdding a new word to our vocabulary opens up new ways of thinking and expressing. Limiting our vocabulary‚Äîlike Big Brother does in George Orwell's 1984‚Äîis a sinister way to limit our thinking.\n\nWith that in mind, instead of trying to limit what we can higher-order notes, we should explore the many flavors of them. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things we can call higher-order notes.\n\n- **Link Note** - A note with a bunch of links.\n- **Hub Note** - A navigational note, like an airport hub (a Luhmann term).\n- **Index Note** - A note that references other notes (sometimes but not always alphabetical).\n- **Workbench** - A brainstorm-y note with a links hastily assembled.\n- **Outline Note** - A note for the early-stage outlining of content.\n- **Structure Note** - A term that describes what it does: structures stuff.\n- **Structure Zettel** - A term from zettelkasten.de - Usually shown as a linear Table of Contents, often with annotations.\n- **Table of Contents** - A finalized structure that references material\n- **MOC (Map of Content)** - A flexible higher-order note that serves all the above purposes of gathering, outlining, structuring, and navigating. In addition, it is an *active thinking tool* that allows for the reshaping, connecting, and building of ideas.\n\nHere's what else an MOC can do:\n\n- MOCs can structure links in completely countless and non-linear ways.\n- MOCs can be a combo of links and tags and text and embeds and anything you can think of.\n- MOCs can be linked to other MOCs (Emergence Level 4), which eventually link to a Home note (Emergence Level 5).\n- And most valuable, [[MOCs concentrate \u0026 accelerate idea interaction]].\n\n---\nNow let's answer the question: [[Why call higher-order notes MOCs]]?\n\n---\n\n- Back Matter\n\t- dates:: 2020-06-28\n\t- created:: 2020-06-28\n\n---","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.068978917Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/What-can-we-learn-from-nerdy-discussions-on-MOCs":{"title":"What can we learn from nerdy discussions on MOCs","content":"up:: [[LYT Kit]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n# What can we learn from nerdy discussions on MOCs?\nSometimes the best way of understanding something is hearing what people have to say about it. \n\n*What is an MOC, in 10 seconds?*\n\n- A non-exclusive folder with a completely customized organizational structure.\n- In an MOC, the party is always happening. It's the \"room where it happens.\" Individual notes can ‚Äúshadow-clone‚Äù themselves and essentially be in multiple parties simultaneous‚Äîinteracting and developing complexity from each party at the same time!\n- Another way to consider MOCs is through \"Idea Emergence\". MOCs are [[Evergreen notes]], just at the next level of emergence.\n\n---\n\n- **Aren't MOCs just index notes?**\n\t- No! MOCs are not static way-points. They are thinking, creating, and writing tools. We are not just map readers. We are the map makers. \n\n---\n\n- **It seems to me creating MOCs creates more work, therefore distracts from note creation, writing and thinking. I cannot see the magic of it.**\n\t- Making MOCs don't distract from note creating and writing, they *are* note creating and writing. \n\t- That's where the magic happens. \n\t- What is the magic? It's having a thinking tool that forces difficult conversations, that highlights holes in arguments, that shines a bright light on ideas that to be developed further. \n\t- See [[MOCs are Dialectics]] for more on this terribly awesome power. \n\n---\n\n- **Why do you need a MOC to lead to other new notes? Isn't that what Direct Links are all about? ...... In other words, what does an MOC achieve that Direct Links don't?**\n\t- Direct Links are the strongest links. But many times we do not want a strong link. We want weaker links. Tags do this and so does naming notes starting with the topic, like: `Mandarin - NOTE1`, `Mandarin - NOTE132`. \n\t- But neither tags, nor alphabetical filenames, allow for a fluid conversation between notes to happen, where their relative positioning can change. MOCs allow for that. \n\t- In a sense, they allow for mini-folgezettels. It's hard to get over how powerful of a thinking tool this is.","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.068978917Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/What-does-X-mean-in-metadata":{"title":"What does X mean in metadata","content":"up:: [[Meta PKM]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n# What does X mean in metadata\nAlthough \"X\" is not a word, it can quickly be intuited. \n\nX is a connection.

It can hold data about a person, or log the phases of the moon. The contents of a note are limited only by our imaginations. \n\nIf a note is \"any container of thought\" then that means the internet has more notes than any one person read in their entire life a thousand times over. \n\nSo let's tighten our definition of a note so it's more practical.\n\nFor you and me, when we talk about a note, we're really talking about containers of thought that mean something to us. \n\nThat means it doesn't matter what's on the entire internet. Which is a relief. Because we don't have to be overwhelmed by all of that. What matter is what notes we've personally taken‚Äîand personally made.\n\nTake note: \n\n\u003e *A note is a container of thought that has meaning for the person who made it.*\n\n---\n\n### Extra Credit Rant\nSo it's a bit subjective. \"One person's trash is another person's treasure.\"\n\nAnd at their best, our notes are treasures.\n\nAt their worst, our notes are overwhelming distraction-riddled collections of  thoughts we've never read that actually act as this static NOISE that distracts us and discourages us from spending time with more meaningful notes.  ^0bffe4\n\nThis is the Collector's Fallacy and it's practiced by the information hoarders, so scared to lose some drop of water from the never-ending information stream, that they never have any time to actually drink from it.  ^e19640\n\nThose people sure have a lot of notes.

Savored it. Digested it. to mix metaphors, what if we wrestled with it, got to know it...in such a way, that we could explain it to a friend‚Äîand they'd get it!\n\nInformation hoarders can't explain the ideas they encounter. They might be able to regurgitate them. And they would even be rewarded for it in today's world with more digital followers. But what a corrupt value system that is.  They are choosing surface-level regurgitation that deprives them of the joy that comes from thinking itself. \n\nThey are trading a nourished soul, for applause.\n\n---\nIf you've read books that meant a lot to you in the moment, but now it feels like you have nothing to show for it...

How many of them have you continued to grow and link to other ideas and experiences? \n\nIf the answer is none, or if it sounds like I'm speaking a foreign language, then you might benefit from learning how to make notes and link ideas that nourish your soul now, and keep growing in value long into the future. \n\nThere's [[The forest entrance|a workshop]] just for that. \n\n%% *PSA* jingle \"the more you know\" %% \n%% This is just another public service announcement from Linking Your Thinking! %%\n\n---\nNext: [[What are higher-order notes]]\n\n---\n\n- Back Matter\n\t- dates:: 2021-01-08\n\n---","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.068978917Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Why-Categories-for-Your-Notes-are-a-Good-Idea":{"title":"Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea","content":"up:: [[LYT Kit]]\ntags:: #on/PKM \n\n# Why Categories for Your Notes are a *Good* Idea\nThe idea that \"categories are bad\" hinges on a faulty notion that categories limit access and cause rigidity that inhibit organic thinking.\n\nThat argument applies to a system of folders. It does not apply to more fluid structures. Let's explore...\n\n**Argument 1**\nCreating categories is a top-down process. You start with the structure and then file the material away. Notes will have to fit the structure. If they don‚Äôt, there‚Äôll have to be a compromise. [^1]\n\n**Counter**\nIf a categorizing framework is set up to be fluid, it is not top down. Notes do not have to fit its structure. There is no compromise. In the case of a Home note, it's a pre-existing structure that you can tether to only when you care to. *It adds context without limiting access.* \n\nHere is that same picture: Wolverine is the note, and your Home note is just another tether:\n![[wolverine-tethered.jpg]]\n\n**Argument 2**\nStatic categories are rigid. Our brains are not rigid. Therefore static categories inhibit our knowledge from growing organically.\n\n**Counter**\nThis is still assuming that \"categories equal top-down oppressive hierarchies.\"But with Maps of Content (MOCs), it's quite the opposite. MOCs spring up organically as the need arises for them. An example is this kit's note called: [[LYT Kit]]; I didn't start with that; I instinctually grasped for it once I felt I had too many notes everywhere. \n\n**Argument 3**\nI don't have categories and I'm doing fine.\n\n**Counter**\nDo you have more than 300 notes or so? You have categories. You just aren't calling them that. \n- Tags are a form of category, they are fluid. They don't scale well as your note collection grows though. [^2] \n- Starred notes are another form of mostly fluid structuring. \n- Do you have \"daily notes\" or timestamped notes? Certainly seems like a category to me; and a rigid one at that! [^3] \nIf you only have notes that are directly linked to other notes‚Äîand nothing else‚Äîthen you can truly say you have no categories. The price for no categorization is steep.\n\nPlease read about the framework most likely to produce a paradigm shift in your knowledge management game: [[MOCs Overview]]. \n\n---\n\n[^1]: Source: \u003ca href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/\"\u003ehttps://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/\u003c/a\u003e From one of the leading minds, Christian is a voice I cherish and he has greatly influenced the broader zettelkasten community. \n[^2]: But if you have Boolean searches to your notes, it *mostly* can mitigate the scaling problem‚Äîthen you'd just have to remember the correct tags, which in practice isn't a certainty.\n[^3]: Even though it's a more rigid category, I just can't give up on the multi-pronged power of the Temporal Context.

Basically ask yourself: *\"What actions and tasks would make today feel like a worthwhile day? How much is realistic? In what order should I do them?\"*\n\nType or write them down.

Writing down your daily goals combats those random attentional detours so you can stay on the main road. \n\nIf you write out your daily goals, you naturally visualize them and prioritize them in the mind, you have a touchstone with which to check your progress throughout the day.

Alan Watts called wu wei ‚Äúnot forcing‚Äù.  \n\nThis reminds me of [[Flow]], the wonderful concept by Mihaly C. \nIt's similar to Flow in that action becomes effortless, but it's different in that...hmm, I see a venn diagram and there is much more overlapping than is not. I would say that Flow may inherently have more intention behind it, but the funny thing is that those intentions melt away once the state of Flow is achieved.\n\nI've experienced [[Wu wei]] in my life when I've chosen not to immediately act on something. (ADD EXAMPLE LATER) In that way, it would seem there are some overlaps between Wu wei and Stoicism. EXPLORE LATER\n\n---\nWu-wei is good because, if I were to view it through a Western lens, it has positive implications for stress management. Attempting to practice Wu-wei (as far as one can practice it without deliberately practicing it!), will help a person focus less on their \"Circle of Concern\" and more on their \"Circle of Influence\". Basically, practicing wu-wei can help us stop worrying about the things we can't control.\n\n---\n\n### Wiki\n\u003e **Wu wei** (Chinese: ÁÑ°ÁÇ∫; pinyin: w√∫w√©i) is an ancient Chinese concept literally meaning \"inexertion\", \"inaction\", or \"effortless action\". Wu wei emerged in the Spring and Autumn period, and from Confucianism, to become an important concept in Chinese statecraft and Taoism, and was most commonly used to refer to an ideal form of government, including the behavior of the emperor.  Describing a state of unconflicting personal harmony, free-flowing spontaneity and savoir-faire, it generally also more properly denotes a state of spirit or mind, and in Confucianism accords with conventional morality.  Sinologist Jean Fran√ßois Billeter describes it as a \"state of perfect knowledge of the reality of the situation, perfect efficaciousness and the realization of a perfect economy of energy\", which in practice Edward Slingerland qualifies as a \"set of ('transformed') dispositions (including physical bearing)... conforming with the normative order\".\n\u003e\n\u003e [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu%20wei)","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.068978917Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/Yin-and-Yang":{"title":"Yin and Yang","content":"up:: [[Concepts MOC]]\ntags:: #concept, #note/developüçÉ \n\n# Yin and Yang\n\n### Wiki\nIn Chinese philosophy, yin and yang is a concept of dualism in ancient Chinese philosophy, describing how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.\n\nThe [[Seasons]] are related to Yin and Yang.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.068978917Z","tags":[]},"/Ideias/You-are-what-you-eat":{"title":"You are what you eat","content":"up:: [[Feedback Loop]]\ntags:: #concept, #note/developüçÉ \n\n# You are what you eat\nGrowing up, I'd here this around the dinner table.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)?

Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website.

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`.

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-04T13:48:19.072979107Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
